I really enjoyed the art style. The animations, strange worlds and bosses were all nice to look at. The game has really simple gameplay consisting mostly of activating different devices in a certain order to get to the next area. The central mechanic was interesting(traveling in and out of different orbs to solve puzzles), unfortunately the puzzles only truly got me to think about them a few times and were never very difficult to figure out. i wish the game had focused a bit more on creating more complex or interesting puzzles to use the games central mechanic. maybe having optional side areas with more difficult puzzles could have provided a better challenge to someone like me that plays a lot of puzzle games\n\nThe central mechanic in this game reminds me of another puzzle game i have played Patricks Parabox, in comparison Cocoon feels more like style over substance. Patricks parabox in compaarison is much uglier but has much better designed puzzles using a similar central mechanic to cocoon but uses it much better by focusing solely on the puzzles and continuously added more and more complicated puzzles. Maybe if cocoon has spent a bit more time on the puzzles instead of the art styles it may have been more engaging. The final puzzle in cocoon is underwhelming because it is so easy. if the game had built on the challenge better and ended with a unique and challenging puzzle it would have left a much bigger impact on me\n\ni recommend if you think you would enjoy a pretty game with simple to novice puzzles.

I guess I would have liked some harder or more mind bending puzzles (though I am a fan of puzzle games and played quite a lot of them)\n- As I've mentioned, the game is pretty short - finished it completely (including all achievements) in under 5 hours. On the one hand I fell like I would've liked more, yet on the other hand it was a very concentrated and curated experience. This is the only part where if you are not a fanatic of Carlsen's or of puzzle games might want to consider if the price to game to time ratio is enough for you. In my opinion it is very much worth my money.\nA uniquely gorgeous experience, one that at least on the puzzle side is very close to portal, and transports you to an artfully imaginative world.

Before we get started: if I see a single complaint about this game being 'too short for the price', I'm going to explode; COCOON, like few other games, maximises every minute to show you something new, and reminds us what games can be when we take the risk to pursue the original.\n\nCOCOON reminds me of a number of games: the wide-eyed wonder and revelations of Outer Wilds, the pick-up-and-put-down trial-and-error puzzling of Wind Waker's later dungeons, the alien environment of... well, it's hard to pick just one, as COCOON journeys you through the macro and the micro, stretching your mind like taffy to comprehend where and when you might be. Without the strong environmental and art design holding it together, you'd get whiplash, but as it stands, worlds which begin novel become familiar over time - which, as it turns out, is key to the gameplay.\n\nThe puzzling premise, here, is diving in and out of glass orbs, each of which contains a world. To keep it as spoiler-free as possible, you soon discover these glass orbs are the core of your puzzling power, as well as the road your journey takes place on. Just as you feel you've discovered the limit of how they can be used, COCOON nudges you a little further, encouraging you to take that mental leap of faith to find a new path forwards.\n\nAnd it really is that - a polite nudge. At no point did I feel like I was headbutting a brick wall in my puzzle-solving. I'm an impatient puzzler, and struggle to get my head around layered puzzles, but COCOON is kind, ensuring I understood the bounds of each puzzle by limiting my area of play, and nearly all frustration is allayed by the feeling that the game wouldn't play tricks on me, or bait me with red herrings. I dislike puzzles of this sort, so if you do, too, you'll hopefully find COCOON is a good balance of puzzle versus progress.\n\nThere are some brief moments of true frustration, though. For instance, one series of solutions relied heavily on timing, which felt mildly incongruous with the puzzles up until that point. But it wasn't by any means enough to shatter my immersion: and what a world to be immersed in. \n\nCOCOON is minimalist. A 5-key control system has you absorbed within moments, the need to learn complex key-binds eliminated. COCOON toys with scale, colour, flora and fauna, perspective, shape, so on and so forth, to communicate lore in what is otherwise a wordless, speechless game, and it's at its best for it. \n\nCOCOON knows exactly what it is, does that extremely well, and leaves you as a player wondering what on earth - or not, as the case may be - you just experienced as you surface for air at its completion.\n\nIt's very good.", "timestamp_created": 1696082279, "timestamp_updated": 1696083181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147354584": {"recommendationid": "147354584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039217370", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 276, "playtime_at_review": 276, "last_played": 1696078881}, "language": "english", "review": "This feels like playing Portal for the first time again", "timestamp_created": 1696079034, "timestamp_updated": 1696079034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636062622070313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147354322": {"recommendationid": "147354322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059695219", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 226, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1696078491}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely enjoyed COCOON. \nWhile the game is not long at all, clocking around 4 hours for me for 100% completion, I really liked the puzzles, the music and atmosphere.

Think Artful Escape, Gris, and of course Limbo and Inside. Annapurna Interactive sure knows how to pick who and what to publish because this game deserves all of the love that its getting. \n\nThere is legitimately not a single part of this game that I can knock. I don't dislike any part of it and thats coming from someone that DESPISES puzzles and puzzle games. The puzzle design and general gameplay felt very good, forcing me to think outside the box a good bit but still very much playing within its own ruleset. \n\nThe best part of this game though is not the gameplay but the presentation, art direction and music all working in harmony. If you are a little wary that the trailers are just showing the good parts of the game? Yeah, those are the boring parts in the trailer, actually. There is a visual feast on display that absolutely blows you away when it gets paired with the atmospheric sound design and a fantastic soundtrack that really does a good job pacing the game out and setting the tone as you move through it. \n\nIt's hard for a puzzle game to increase in complexity without getting overly complex, but Cocoon managed to not only increase the loose narrative stakes throughout the game, but it also gradually increased the complexity of puzzles in an impressive way that kept surprising me. I love how they used the mechanics like building blocks ending with some genuine brain tickling tests that force you to use all of the tools available to you and show that you were in fact not getting lucky up to that point, but understanding EXACTLY how the puzzle mechanics worked. That being said, it was again, very fair and unfrustrating to work through. \n\nFor completionists, there is a function after you beat the game that allows you to go back to any specific point in the game to acquire all of the things you were missing so don't focus too hard on the extra stuff your first playthrough if you wanna get all achievements, just have a good time and enjoy yourself and you can go back later to find what you need. (It also has a statue that shows you where and what you are missing for the extra goodies so no need to guess where stuff is)\n\nI wish I had more to say beyond, \"Hey, this kicks ass\", but I don't. This is precisely what is advertised on the outside of the box and does a great job at providing surprises the whole way through that keeps you intrigued and engaged. This is one of those sleeper games that won't get mentioned come GOTY time but absolutely deserves a nod for being fantastic in 2023, a year that is jam PACKED with great games.\n\nEasily recommended. \n\nFollow my steam curator page for more reviews on indies like this, which helps.\n\n[code] https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42143664/ [/code]", "timestamp_created": 1696033797, "timestamp_updated": 1696033797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518013596534729004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147318057": {"recommendationid": "147318057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148214188", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 214, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1696033920}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, short game", "timestamp_created": 1696033631, "timestamp_updated": 1696033631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147317485": {"recommendationid": "147317485", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984200606", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1515, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1696106839}, "language": "english", "review": "Delightfully intuitive puzzler with a great difficulty curve.

LIMBO and INSIDE by Playdead are both excellent games, but also his lesser known solo work, 140 and THOTH are terrific in their own right. If you have played the latter, you might remember my name from one of the achievements. I even had the honor of meeting Jeppe Carlsen, Jakob Schmid and some other (ex-)Playdead folk and I still cherish the memories of that night.\n\nWhen I heard that Carlsen had left Playdead to start his own studio, I was sad on one hand, because I had valued his puzzle design of their games as feeling integral to the world. But on the other hand, I felt excited for what was to come.\n\nKnowing Carlsen's work well, I expected this game to put a huge emphasis on game feel and intuitive player guidance with excellent sound design and music integration. And this is pretty much what I got, but I did not, even after watching the trailers, expect this game to look so absolutely gorgeous all of the time on screen.\n\nThe game controls nice and fluid, everything can be done with eight directions and a single button. If you play on controller, you have analog movement controls but your character's idle animation can only appear in said eight directions. The music is more calm and atmospheric but there are occasional intense sections in the soundtrack, fitting the action on screen.\n\nWhat really boggles my mind is the puzzle design. Knowing Carlsen, I did not expect any less, but the way in which mechanics are introduced to the player, consecutively in didactically designed challenges to the point where it feels completely natural to come up with the solution for the next puzzle made me speechless. There was never a time in the game where I felt lost or stuck, I always had the drive forward but at the same time, the puzzles always provided the right amount of challenge to me and did not seem trivial to solve.\n\nThere are very few very, very minor nitpicks that I still feel obliged to state here. The game starts with a \"cold start\" opening which is always cool, but from the player perspective, specifically on PC not always the best, since it prevents players from checking the game\u2019s settings. As a result, the game started, at least for me, in 1080p and 60fps despite my monitor supporting 1440p 144fps and these gorgeous graphics deserve the crispest resolution you can offer them.
