Sure you're beating up the same people over and over again, but there is enough to interrupt the mindless slashing with quick thinking and strategy at least on highest difficulty.

All you had to do is to give us a musou game with servants. In the meantime you see comments like \"MOMMY MUSASHI\" and \"JALTER MY BELOVED\", but you are playing Musashi for a total of 15 minutes, and then JAlter you play for like 15 seconds, only for A SINGLE SECTION they let you control Jeanne. This is fucked up. Actually, no, this is beyond fucked up. I don't even care if that spoils the game to someone because I bought this game for the premise of playing as JAlter because I thought they'll give you like a Free Mode type thing where you can replay encounters with anyone you want, BUT NO, THERE IS NO SUCH THING. Don't be lured in by all the positive feedback. Maybe they'll give you more servant gameplay through season pass, but have you seen the price for that shit?! Doubt it'll be worth it. And if that means that you're playing more Iori, then double no from me. Game does look amazing, and I love the artstyle of it, but goddamn am I just empty after clearing it.\nAlso, three billion tutorials.\n\nYour main gameplay loop is playing the weakest musou character they could come up with, Iori. Why is he the weakest? Well cause everyone gets hyper armor whenever you are fighting as him. The only way to actually deal damage to anyone larger than you is to break their armor by countering or just waiting till their move is done and then time your strikes while their defence is \"lowered\". You wanna have fun and play a cool character, which is basically like any servant in the game? We got you. Here's a bar that lasts ~20 seconds that you have to grind for 30 years as Iori, and then maybe by divine intervention you can play a servant until you've just barely familiarized yourself with their movesets. People who played through the game will tell me \"BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU PLAY SERVANTS ONLY\" and yeah, sure, that would be an argument if you could play them for more than 15 minutes of in-game time. But alas, this is not what Fate game is about I guess. Totally not. Don't be fooled, you're not playing servants in this game for the most part. Even NG+ is just that, it's same game but with your progress already being there. I'm disappointed beyond belief. I pre-ordered it because I dreamed of a musou game with servants, given Extella was the only thing closest to that, so I had hopes when I saw Koei making a Fate game. Beaten it because that's the only way I can justify spending money on this piece of shit. And even then it just left me with a bigger feeling of disappointment. Cause the whole time I played, I was hoping that the game will allow me to just pick servants I wanna play as and ditch the stupid and weak Iori. I just wanted a musou game with servants that's not riddled with stupid tile-conquering gameplay shtick and I couldn't even get that, unbelievable. \nDo not buy this. Just don't. Maybe on sale 10 years later along with whatever content comes out for it later, but not full price.

You have a roster of very cool and mysterious servants who all of their true names hidden. The masters are interesting and the dynamic between master-servant pairs is actually relevant again.\n- Character designs have returned to that grounded Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero style. This game is a breath of fresh air from the overly \"Tropey and Anime\" designs that FGO and Fate/Apocrypha started to introduce.\n- The cutscenes are fantastic. I feel like I'm watching Unlimited Blade Works again for the first time when a fight scene is being shown.\n- Character progression is easy to understand and meaningful. The moves you learn are flashy and fun to use. Changing stances actually changes the way you play\n- Enemy designs are either completely new or taken from FGO and given a nice makeover. If you remember the little Onis from Shimousa or the Kintoki rider event, those make an appearance and they actually look creepy.\n- There's a saint quartz joke.\n- Grail Front inspired combat makes it in the game with a fresh coat of paint and is very fun.\n- You get paid to pet dogs and cats.\n- Noble Phantasms look pretty badass.\n- Voice acting is pretty great.\n    - Gilgamesh\n\nCons:\n- This style of JRPG isn't for everyone. It plays similar to Extella or Hyrule Heroes in the sense that its designed kind of like a hoard hack and slash. It's redeemed by the fact that major targets/bosses have cool moves and are fun to fight against. I was hesitant my money was well spent at first but the gameplay improved.\n- Your servant is another saberface, which is a minor critique at best. Her character design is changed enough that she definitely looks unique.\n- If you aren't on controller you're gonna need to do some serious work on key-bind remapping to make the game feel good. Once you find your sweet spot though it plays pretty good.\n- That's it.

It only took 20 years. Accessible entry point for newcomers that want to see what the franchise is about.\n\nThe main warning I'd give is that, like the VN, there is a *lot* of reading. The game really revels in creating a distinct sense of place, and it benefits greatly from this. In much the same way you come to learn the streets of kamurocho in Yakuza, you get similar vibes here, plus the historical aspect which is omnipresent.\n\nCombat is solid, and good enough for the fraction of the game it takes up. Would have preferred a full character action style  but the game layers a lot of additional systems on top of the basic musou light and heavy system. Boss fights are genuinely really quite good, and the hard difficulty is punishing, but not crazy hard or anything.\n\nGraphics are pleasant enough but not cutting edge by any means. Could probably have been a PS3 game, albeit not with this resolution and framerate.

You take the role of of Iori Miyamoto, disciple of the legendary Miyamoto Musashi. Iori earns his living by doing odd jobs, following his code of honour to keep the peace. After a strange mark appears on the back of one of his hands, the young man finds himself unwillingly drawn into the Waxing Moon Ritual. In a desperate situation, Iori manages to summon a Servant and confirm his participation in the Ritual as Master. Saber is summoned...\n\nFor a newcomer to the Fate franchise, the beginning is usually difficult. Even though Fate has anime adaptations and one of the longest-running mobile games, it's still difficult to introduce a newcomer to the Fate Series without giving them a link to a 5k page wiki... Nevertheless, it was difficult before Fate/Samurai Remnant. The game gently introduces you to the Fate universe, explaining absolutely everything you need to know to fight effectively in a Holy Grail War. I was surprised at how simply and effectively the game explained what are relatively difficult concepts!\n\nAlthough Fate/Samurai Remnant is essentially an action-RPG, it offers a long, detailed and complete story, a quality that lives up to the standards of the Fate franchise. Veteran fans of the franchise will find all the ingredients of a good Type-Moon title here. The story explains every element and rule of a Holy Grail War in detail, ensuring that those unfamiliar with the franchise will be able to follow the story smoothly and easily. Once you've completed the game, you can start a new game to access an extended storyline, a modified ending and brand new scenes that give you even more information about the lore. A classic Type-Moon.\n\nOf course, I can't talk about Fate/Samurai Remnant without mentioning Saber. Ah, Saber... I've lost count of the number of times my quest told me to go right when Saber was on my left, gazing at a food stall... Probably one of the most endearing characters in the entire Fate series! The bond that develops between Iori and Saber is one of the highlights of the game. Little by little, Iori gets to know and understand Saber. In exchange, Saber will get used to Iori's calm and peaceful character, while trying to understand how Miyamoto Musashi's student sees the world... The other characters won't leave you unmoved either. You'll quickly feel a sense of friendship for the Rogue Servants, while surprising yourself with compassion for the other Master-Servant duo, who all have their own stories to tell. You'll also be given a few lessons in history and mythology to help you understand the \"power\" of the True Names of the Servants!\n\nIn terms of Gameplay, it would be a bit reductive to say that this is a simple Musou. While Saber can wipe out weak enemies with a single blow, the bosses are... Much more difficult. If you want to understand why I thought first of a \"inspired\" Souls-like game, just play Iori and turn the difficulty up to the max... The boss stages will be a real challenge! The different styles of Iori's swords prevent repetition in battle and force you to rethink your strategy, as Iori adapts his style to his opponents in order to win. I particularly liked the stark difference in power between Iori and Saber. You feel all the weakness of a simple, brave human and the monstrous power of a true Heroic Spirit! This difference is also felt when Iori confronts a Servant. Without Saber's help, it's hard to imagine Musashi's adopted son winning... Each Servant has their own unique fighting style, so you'll enjoy trying them all!\n\nIn conclusion, Fate/Samurai Remnant is an excellent introduction to the Fate Series. Beginners will discover all the basics of the universe while enjoying a story full of twists and turns and terribly engaging characters. As for confirmed fans, I'm not taking the slightest risk in saying that you'll find what you're looking for as a Fate series fan in this title!

Completely tied to nothing else in any way\n\nNow for my 7.5hr review:\nThe beginning of the story is about how any other Fate story would go, but now set in the Edo period of Japan.\nThe Masters are all very unique. So are the Master's Servants and Rogue Servants\nThe gameplay has a lot going for it. From little mini-games like honing your blade and woodcarving to core gameplay mechanics having tag team systems and link attacks.\n\nMY MAIN DRAWBACK FROM THE GAME:\nLike the Fate/Extella games, the controls on mouse and keyboard are atrocious.

I was probably going to like this game regardless, so feel free to let that color everything else I have to say.\n\nI was immediately apprehensive when it was announced and in the trailer there was the Omega Force logo. Omega Force are excellent developers, but they live in their niche and thrive there. As great as Omega Force are at diversifying the gameplay in their licensed Warriors titles, it's already been done in the franchise with both Extella and Extella Link being musou games. \n\nThankfully, they managed to find an excellent balance with what they know and new mechanics. Combos initially flow like those in a musou game, linear chains of light attacks followed with a heavy, but they inject a need to react and play off the opponents that is so often missing from their more typical fare.\n\nThey also manage to make the player character feel strong and useful, while demonstrating the huge gulf that exists between Masters and Servants as far as their strength. You don't feel underpowered or useless, but you absolutely do need your Servant to survive. Enemies aren't like those in other Omega Force titles, they can take a beating and if you fail to stay on your toes, they will punish you and easily deplete your HP bar.\n\nStrictly viewing this as a Fate/ game, this is the best adaptation of a Holy Grail War in any non-Visual Novel game so far. It perfectly captures the delicate act of having to balance the facade of daily life while also uncovering the other Masters, preparing for nightfall when the veil of secrecy is easier to maintain and all out Servant vs Servant combat can really take place. \n\nAs far as the story they do retread some well-worn story beats, borrowing from tropes established in more than a few Fate/ stories. It does make for an excellent introduction to the franchise for first timers though, and a entrenched fan will probably find it nostalgic.

The gameplay is yet another Musou game with a band-aid on it in a terrible attempt to pretend it is an action RPG in the Musou engine that has made copy/paste trash but with whatever IP logo on the same game since the early 2000s. Rather than make a real game or take any risks, all these companies pay this company to shit out another turd with a new name and the same copy paste animations and attacks and same terrible AI enemies with rocks for brains that have been there from the first game. The story hits all the same copy/paste of every other Fate series game, insert Saber, can't tell you her name, cute and charming so you like her, protagonist is boring self insert unlikable trash.\n\nI will be so happy when the Fate series finally drops the horrible shitty Musou developers and their horrible trash tier combat systems and PS2 style graphics. Get it on sale for $20-30 at most. It's just another trash Musou game with BARELY more mechanics, but a polished turd is still a turd. Musou games are bottom tier effort cheap trash that even mobile phone games out class these days in Gameplay. Save your money and don't encourage them to keep going for cheap cash grabs like this. The day they drop the Musou developers, is the day I start buying every Fate game to release as I'm a huge Fate fan and I want a decent game to buy and play, but they just won't give me one.\n\nThis game serves as an excellent litmus test for which review companies or channels are lying to you. If anyone dares give this higher than a 7.0/10 then you know they are the most die hard Fate fan to the point they are hallucinating a good game or they literally never touched a good game before in their life and are only comparing it to the cheapest worst anime knockoff games made. If you want a solid Fate title, sadly, Melty Blood is still the only thing you have. Melty Blood is worth more than the 18th Musou game with the Fate logo slapped on it and the recreation of the same story but with minor tweaks.\n\nI want a good Fate game as much as I want a Saber arc anime from Ufotable. Fate is my favorite series and that is all the more why it is so infuriating to see cheap anime fan cash grabs rather than a game that does the series justice. If you are ok buying the 13th Musou game that is absolutely no different from the last 23 they made, by all means, enjoy. But those with half decent taste in games will stay away.

It's really technically smooth too for me; haven't run into any crashes or anything like that. Some occasional stutter while loading shaders but that goes away the more you play. I have heard about the cutscene skipping bug some people are experiencing; I really hope that Omega Force fixes it, since this game is pretty darn good at first shot.\n\nYou got an open world with different zones to walk around and do missions in, you got some navigation that can be done with the help of your servant, dual techs, follow-up strikes, you can temporarily swap to your servant and fight as them for a while, you equip gear, learn spells that use consumables... it's pretty expansive, and has a lot of strong RPG elements that give each character a strong progression curve. The musou combat is on point, though I wish the battles were larger. I hope they get larger later in the game.\n\nI've seen some people liken the game to the RGG Studios games as well; walking around town, doing small missions and favors and errands for people, and yeah I would say that's present but not really that oppressive. The point of the game is to ease you into the battles and get you used to these micro-encounters with 25-50 enemies at once, much like Persona 5 Strikers did.\n\nI think the main problem with this game though, for most people, is probably going to be that it's pretty niche for what it is; you have to really be a neutral-to-positive fan of both musou games and TYPE MOON, particularly Fate, to really like this. If you are, then this will probably be one of your favorite games to come out this year; and you also probably don't need to be convinced by me to buy it.\n\nBut, for the rest of the internet, I think it's probably worth waiting for a sale. This definitely isn't a game that you can use to get into Fate; the story is a mimicry of the core beats of the original Fate/stay Night story, but it won't tell you about anything you'll see in the other big name Fate franchises, instead being more of an isolated story that uses similar themes and ideas. It might be a game you can use to get into the musou genre, but because of its open world and RPG elements, it's very different from the more mission and campaign-based structure of the mainline Dynasty Warriors games, or even the earlier spinoff licensed titles like One Piece: Pirate Warriors, Berserk & The Band Of The Hawk or Hyrule Warriors.\n\nThe bottom line is, for fans this is exactly what they want, but for anyone who isn't already in on this type of game or franchise, there's nothing here that will blow your mind or turn you into a fan of either that couldn't be found in one of the games I mentioned earlier in this review. Because of that, while I can easily recommend this to a certain type of person, if you're not really familiar with TYPE MOON or with the musou genre, I would wait for this one to go on sale before you experiment with it.\n\nFor the rest of you, you've probably already made up your mind about this game; go download it and play it!

For one, the core combat mechanics are actually pretty good, great even. You get a handful of stances to swap between and are actually encouraged to do so depending on your HP level, how many enemies you are fighting, and what stats you want to prioritize. It adds a good bit of depth to the otherwise mashfest that is Musou-style gameplay. There is still a bit of mashing, but I liked the extra layers added here.\n\n[h2]Gameplay Loop & Difficulty[/h2]\nIt is just unfortunate that this combat is stuck with some incredibly repetitive and tedious mission design. The game literally opens with you helping a guy collect debts from random people around town. That\u2019s how bad it is.\n\nWhen you are not running random errands as main story quests, you are dealing with this absolutely tedious turn-based board game style travel system. You have to travel between nodes to get to your destination and if you run into an enemy along the way, jump into a copy-paste arena to fight them in.\n\nAnd the enemies are copy-paste too. You will be fighting the same type of samurai and a handful of monsters the entire game. You occasionally get some new, interesting ones, but it just becomes tiring spamming buttons against the same enemies battle after battle. Especially so given how this game manages its difficulty level: by simply raising enemy HP. Bosses especially, since they get an extra armor meter that just takes forever to break before you actually do damage. It\u2019s not like the bosses are even hard, just boring and time-consuming.\n\n[h2]Story[/h2]\nThe gameplay is only about half of the experience, maybe just 30-40% of it. The rest is visual novel style storytelling, which I honestly don\u2019t mind as a VN fan, but not so when it is as wordy and full of fluff like it is here. For every actual cutscene, you get a full 30 minute dinner dialogue scene. One cool character reveal, and then an info dump where a character explains a simple concept to death as if I was five years old.\n\nIt\u2019s just frustrating. Boring and frustrating. I know the Fate franchise is full of lengthy stories, but I don\u2019t recall ever being as bored with them as I was here. The pacing is just far too slow.\n\n[h2]Performance / PC Port[/h2]\nI had no issues playing at 4k 120fps, although it was a bit weird that the game is divided into performance and quality modes on PC, the latter of which listed a 60fps limit. The game still looked fine in performance mode - at least, for this developer\u2019s standard - so I can\u2019t say I minded all that much. There are a bunch of video settings to change too, so props to the devs for that instead of just leaving it as one slider as they have definitely done in the past.\n\n[h2]Overall[/h2]\nI cannot recommend Fate/Samurai Remnant. There are obviously some good ideas here, especially with the combat mechanics, but the gameplay loop, the mission design, and the story full of filler really sour the experience. The Fate/Extella games may have their issues, but they are at least better than this.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews + videos!", "timestamp_created": 1695949260, "timestamp_updated": 1695949260, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484509915113449097", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147388480": {"recommendationid": "147388480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062486540", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 202, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1696108352}, "language": "english", "review": "All good.
