It's got all the fun of setting up and operating successful businesses while using the drug theme as a way to keep it different and interesting. If you are looking for a business management/tycoon game that's not too overly complex, but still has a lot of depth to fine tune things, this is the game for you!\n\nBeen playing this game since the day it released into early access and I have loved every minute of it. There is just something super satisfying about setting up the factory and businesses and watching it all come together in harmony. It's also incredibly satisfying to start off with just a basic set up and watch it grow into a empire with multiple drug types and tiers.\n\nI also personally enjoy the art style of the game. It gives a somewhat simple feel to the game while still including enough details to really see whats happening in the world.\n\nTo sum it all up, DNFC is an amazing business management game themed around drug trade. It's incredibly satisfying to play, visually pleasing to look at, and has a banger soundtrack to boot.\n\nI seriously cannot recommend this game enough.", "timestamp_created": 1695996514, "timestamp_updated": 1695996514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603980183601379395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147208765": {"recommendationid": "147208765", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096790519", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1438, "playtime_at_review": 2239, "last_played": 1696104324}, "language": "english", "review": "Walter White doesn't have $#!@ on me", "timestamp_created": 1695909299, "timestamp_updated": 1695909299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539591550827026367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147205383": {"recommendationid": "147205383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039198426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 112, "playtime_at_review": 4378, "last_played": 1696079381}, "language": "english", "review": "legitness just get it", "timestamp_created": 1695906459, "timestamp_updated": 1695906459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515003085136413574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147147294": {"recommendationid": "147147294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198985811065", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1695841738}, "language": "english", "review": "goop", "timestamp_created": 1695840532, "timestamp_updated": 1695840532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147132188": {"recommendationid": "147132188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089799710", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 132, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1695822880}, "language": "english", "review": "its fun and all but i cannot for the life of me figure out what to do.. despite playing the tutorial! so i dont think ill be playing it more.. but im sure its a very fun game if ur not permanently confused like i am. i never get customers and i cant figure out how to actually deliver the drugs lol", "timestamp_created": 1695825961, "timestamp_updated": 1695825961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419313877820968628", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147120597": {"recommendationid": "147120597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036741953", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1765, "playtime_at_review": 419, "last_played": 1696102895}, "language": "english", "review": "I have fallen in love with this game and I can't wait to see what is to come of this game!", "timestamp_created": 1695813770, "timestamp_updated": 1695813770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147059357": {"recommendationid": "147059357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367524317", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 594, "playtime_at_review": 561, "last_played": 1695737044}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has got so much potential and I can't wait to see where it goes.

Definitely not good for beginner players of this genre, doesn't really explain much just kinda drops you in, gives you a few directions, and then lets you have at it. Couldn't really figure out what to do, my employees started dying of starvation, my lamps started breaking, and I had no input as to how to fix either. Wouldn't let me hire engineers like I thought you would need to do to fix the lights, and wouldn't let me add snack machines which I thought would be what you need to put down to feed your employees.

Knowing that it's in early access, I am looking forward to more expansion on narcotics trade as a whole. There are so many challenges that could be added in, from DEA raids, selling to cops and being punished, dealing with customers who are active in addiction then go to rehab so you lose sales, and investigations from the government. \n\nAs it stands, [i]Definitely Not Fried Chicken[/i] trends in a way that seems to glamorize the cartel lifestyle, without showing the really heinous parts of drug manufacturing and use. I am not displeased with the weed part of the game, its fun for the most part. Making edibles and prerolls would be a cool addition, as well as a campaign to legalize so you can have a legit store like we do in the better parts of the U.S. \n\nWith the meth update, that's where my liking of this game went south. Knowing someone who has recovered from meth abuse, this is [i]insultingly[/i] simplified. Meth is a serious drug that ruins lives and families, its not so easy that people can just buy it once and wait. They should be pounding on the door for it. There should be tweakers busting into cars and robbing stores, I want to see the *real* things that go down with the drug industry, as it stands now, there just isn't enough depth.\n\nI hope the devs can learn from people who are either in active addiction or have become sober. There is so much more to this lifestyle that is completely omitted.

The Youtube series where I take a look at games i think seem cool & give my thoughts on them in less than 10 mins. I review games in the following format, Buy it Now! Wait for Sale & Do Not Buy!\n\nToday I'm gonna be taking a look at an EARLY ACCESS version Definitely Not Fried Chicken, a business management sim with a Break Bad twist. Start off as a humble entrepreneur hiring local inner-city farmers & chemists then buy out lots to launder I mean invest in Laundromats, Donut Shops, Fried Chicken & Seafood restaurants. (Night Clubs & Casinos coming at a later date). Have your base of operations distribute your narcotics throughout the city while in competition with a chicken icon in The Major. Could you be this quaint town's new kingpin? Or is DNFC Definitely Not a Good time? Lets find out.\n\n\n\n//Graphics, Sound & Artstyle//\n\nThere's a grimy box pixel art type of aesthetic that perfectly suits this game, the sfx are phenomenal- while a bit repetitive at times, I can clearly hear when my workers are being productive with as much going on. Its welcoming to be able to make it out. The music, just doesn't resonate with me.\n\n\n//Gameplay//\n\nIf you like a meticulous micromanagement business sim, this is the one for you. Hire workers for your growhouse from Peons, Engineers, Cleaners and even security. Set their schedules so they dont burn out but also enough to produce product to move. Get a few garages to send your product on mopeds, have them go to specific customers in a map & route them out. Don't like only sending one pound of product? Send some over to the junkyard to unlock cars & trucks to move even more product. Want to grow different strains or even get in the more lucrative field of narcotics? Send some over to the university & they'll start selling you their stuff. But surely with as much money as you will be making, people will notice right? Buy out lots & build business to keep the fuzz off your back- or also distribute directly to customers from your business. Set schedules for your business and make passive income the.. legal way. \n\n\n\n\n//Price//\n\n24.99 USD\n\n\n//How many hours estimated//\n\nI'm only about 6.5 hours in, and ive only touched the surface I believe. Its a slow grind but very much one of those, let me just get 15 more mins in type of games.\n\n\n//Is it Playable on Steamdeck?//\n\nWhile it is playable, I wouldn't recommend it for SteamDeck. You have to be meticulous about your scheduling and going back & forth between lots until you have that perfect schedule set that allows you to bring enough income in to warrant leaving it alone. \n\n\n//Wishlist//\n\n*Ability to move rooms, as of now you have to kind of completely renovate everything\n*Promotions- giving the ability for workers to make other workers take a break or open businesses without you.\n*More vehicles for transporting product, 2 & 3 package vehicles like smaller car or a bigger moped that can load 2\n*Options to start selling higher quality narcotics at start, I couldn't open a restaurant because I hadn't unlocked the equipment to make the harder stuff.\n*the ability to rename workers, & shops\n*you setting the hours for your businesses, I mean I grew up around shady 24 hr Laundromats & Donut Shops.\n*setting prices. for the product, for the washing machines, dryers, gumball machines, detergent. setting the prices a bit higher would be nice.\n*multiple businesses on a single lot. lets say like a strip mall where you can take your dry cleaning to, can grab a donut & maybe even an arcade \n*more business types! like i mentioned, dry cleaning, arcade, skating rink, mattress stores, just a bunch of business types that everyone questions how they're in business despite never seeing anyone in there.\n*better UI\n*finally, more drug types. \n\n\n\n//Final Thoughts//\n\nI absolutely love Definitely Not Fried Chicken. The silly animations, the in depth mechanics, I spent a hell of a lot longer making my laundromat the way I wanted it though, while I allowed the factory or grow-house to just do whatever they wanted (i did have to hire a few workers when I did check back at the grow-house because id work em to death). I'm about 7 hours in and I still haven't even made my donut, chicken or seafood restaurant, I love the hard grind but therein lies some problems.\n\nWith workers, their needs are always deteriorating. But if you don't have em on a scheduled break they just wont do anything. I've set a system for my business with Schedule 0,1,2. On 0 they work from 0600 to 1900 but if i see they're unhappy i will switch em over to 1, with is basically break time all day except for 2000 to 23000 when it's time to receive a package from my growhouse, 2 is to send em home. I'm still tinkering with scheduling but that seems to be the best for me yet sometimes it's a bit overwhelming. If I go over to improve the growhouse and forget to open the Laundromat then i miss on having passive income that has certainly helped me. Why not leave it open then you ask? Because my machines need maintenance every single day, so I hire an engineer to come and fix em. Cant exactly bring him over when I forget to switch him over to schedule 0. I'd love little reminders or even a \"phone call or text\" from my workers to say \"hey boss are we open today or nah\". Any prompt really. I'd also love to have a ranking system for workers. Like they can level up and be supervisor, manager etc to give them a bit more responsibility & help your crew in need. Why cant the cleaner who just stands around when she's done also accept product? It's not like they dont clean the warehouse where we keep narcotics?\n\nAlso while I'm enjoying the long grind, it seems pretty daunting to unlock everything you need to make more money. 90 pts or 45 packages of good weed or 90 packages of bad weed to unlock a car! Now that I've replaced my mopeds with cars, I don't always have enough product to move. The dispatch system also seems kinda broken. If we get so much hands on work, why not allow our dispatchers to deliver certain kind of product to one customer and while having another one highlighted deliver the rest to that one? Once you get a hotline, customers will light it up to get you to deliver to them, its only until recently however that i realized i could charge more for a promise of better quality product. \n\nAnd if I'm being completely honest, ive been having a HELL of a good time just running my little laundromat. Getting all the permits to get the absolute best equipment, maximizing my passive income, while also managing the workers there. I almost forget, oh yeah we're running a drug line here \n\n\nAs a shell, this game has the potential to be one of the greatest of all time. So good on the devs for releasing this in EA. While it is almost finished besides adding (ocaine, nightclubs & casinos) the game would be a LOT better with some tweaks (no pun intended) here and there. I have a wishlist since Jan, so for me this is def worth a buy However buyer be warned that this is an extremely niche title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess it's a tricky one but if you were on the fence about getting it, BUY IT NOW! & if you're just shopping around, WAIT FOR SALE! \n\n\n\n\n\n[h1]Buy it Now![/h1]\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691670995, "timestamp_updated": 1691670995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558357656002044678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143748605": {"recommendationid": "143748605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198833711115", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1696007799}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm actually really excited  to see where this game  goes hopefully they will add some Gangs and have a mode where you get more  planning involved as much as I love the character  the boss  I would love to engage  in more criminal activity and cooking fried  chicken.", "timestamp_created": 1691625107, "timestamp_updated": 1691625107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143697881": {"recommendationid": "143697881", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990135098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2075, "last_played": 1691558504}, "language": "english", "review": "Not yet... cool game, has all the right components but too many bugs...

With 15 workers, the scroll bar for the employee tab is only available when room groups are unselected, but room groups were essential as I had multiple products being produced. 2nd bug was when an attack happened after the mayor got elected. An attacker has been permanently stuck in my factory, so all employees cower as if there's an attack going on, but even when hiring new security they don't know the attacker is there. So the entire factory is shut down and can't operate and there's no way to \"stop the attack\" which the game thinks is active, when its not.

At its core, it's a resource management and supply lines game. \n\nAt this point in development, it is very reminiscent of someone's free-to-play flash-game passion-project. There's a lot there, it's fun, it's creative, but it's jank and very little QOL implemented. But there's a lot of potential, and the devs are active in development. \n\nSpeaking to the inevitable early-access jank:\nAfter running for 2 or 3 hours it gets glitchy and the AI bugs-out and build-mode gets funky. Everything breaks down, but it is still technically playable, just the AI might keep going around in circles or walk around the entire property to use the rear door rather than walk out back. If you enter build-mode and place some rooms, the price will stick on your mouse through gameplay until you go back into build-mode and select then de-select remove room tool. At least, that's the fastest way I've found to fix that. Also, when placing room tiles, the flooring textures won't change. You'll have a dirty, earthen floor until you restart the game. Then everything fixes itself and the floors appear properly and the AI behaves normally. \nIf any of these things happen, it's definitely worth a restart as the others are not far behind.\n\nThe QOL mechanics are bare-bones. So much is missing from it, as other reviews have pointed-out. Transporting your goods via vehicles seems like an okay system at first, but there is very little customization to it, no custom labeling to easily tell one from another, no customizing their loads numerically (you can flag it open to multiple drugs, but how much is added of each is random and up to the AI, which is also randomly performing whatever tasks you've flagged for them), etc. They will depart from your \"factory\" only when full, and will attempt to stop at the chosen destination. If it can't, it'll keep circling the block until there's space. Once it reaches its destination it will sit there until others unload it. If you are trying to ship resources to one of your businesses, and the shelf storage for a particular drug is full, the vehicle will sit there indefinitely until space is freed and the last drug is unloaded from the vehicle, or if you manually tell it to return to the factory. That can REALLY fuck with your supply-chain. Also, since flagging a vehicle to multiple drugs just lets the AI randomly load things into it (no numerically customization), it's DEFINITELY worth buying a separate vehicle and using only a single drugs per vehicle. That gets to be an expensive upkeep, but that's the best system I've found. Also, once you have enough drugs to make that especially expensive, you've probably making a whole lot of money, anyway. Businesses make a good profit, even without your drugs. The Laundromat, not-so-much (it's a laundromat. No expensive dry-cleaning, just the cheap washers and dryers, and the businesses all have a maximum capacity determined by the star-rating. That is another complain of mine. Bustling businesses are a myth because of this maximum capacity that is enforced, regardless of accomodations).\nI'd LOVE to see a blue-print system implemented into the game. Construction can get tedious, and I find myself constantly looking back to my older businesses to look at the design I thought worked well so I can copy that over to the new business. Cut/copy/paste would also be great. Moving a room as a whole, extending a wall, etc. What they got works, but it's missing some QOL improvements. Looking at this, I've really taken The Sims building mode for granted.\n\nIt's still early-access, and the developers are active. That's promising.

As the saying goes, all that glitters isn't gold; and in DNFC, all that fries certainly isn't chicken.\n\nIn DNFC, you're no mere observer. Instead, you're an active participant in the bustling cityscape, donning the dual hat of a respected entrepreneur and a secretive narcotics mogul. DNFC's tutorial offers you a compass to navigate this complex labyrinth. However, like a master painter with a canvas, it provides you the tools but leaves the masterpiece creation to you.\n\nThe game's charm is skillfully baked into its attention to detail. Each decision, from buying plots for your drug compound, mapping production lines, to orchestrating distribution routes, impacts your empire. Couple this with the task of safeguarding your operations from prying eyes, and you have an intricate, immersive world that rewards both strategy and creativity.\n\nYet, the game\u2019s essence doesn't lie solely in the clandestine operations. The vibrant townsfolk, with their outrageous demands, add a splash of color to your journey. Fulfilling their eccentric requests not only unlocks secret costumes but also provides an enjoyable respite from your core operations, amplifying DNFC\u2019s appeal.\n\nMaintaining your cover through proper management of your 'legal' businesses is just as crucial.

I've restarted 3 separate saves just for them to not load past 75%. I even waited for an update before leaving a review in hope it was coming. \nThis is a HUGE issue and its been an issue since release. There's even another review that the developers responded to saying they were looking into it. That was nearly 7 months ago and its still not fixed. Until it is. I don't recommend it. Early access games are bound to have issues but not being able to access the game should be the number one concern. Just wait for the full release and hopefully it will be fixed at that point.\n\nUpdate: Game full released today and I tested all the saves.

I feel it does need some major adjustments before it becomes playable though. I feel like doors should only take up the square they swing out to. I think you don't earn enough money from the game, I think the values need to be increased slightly by around 1-5$ per transaction. I think that one major issue is that people don't show up to work on time, If I send people home and their work starts at 8 they shouldn't be rolling in at 9:37 and me still be paying them for an hour of work that didn't happen. I feel like there needs to be more than 6 schedules, maybe 6 schedules for each type of worker. I think that you should also be able to prioritize tasks. Ex. This employee will run the register, if no customer's are around he will prep chicken and fries. My biggest pet peeve is that I feel I cannot make a profit unless I am constantly adjusting everything my employees are doing. I feel once I set up my entire shop and get things running it should stay running unless a disaster strikes or I over value something like no time for food. Finally, if an employee has nothing to do they should use that time to use the break room and fix their stats. Its a really fun and creative game, with extreme potential.

Love sim games that let you build your own custom workshops and have workers assigned to jobs.\n\nUnderstand this is an early access review as of 6/24/23 \nSeems like there is going to be a lot more added in the future that will make even better automation possible and better production as well. \n\nMy current gripes about the game are relatively small but here are some I wish would be implemented\n1. Exit to Main Menu Button. Not just an exit game button.\n2. Dispatch groups and auto dispatching so I don't have to open the dispatch menu every 10 seconds to assign separate vehicles to make deliveries. I would like them to complete and assign them on their own but also have a separate grouping for delivering to businesses only or time limited deliveries.\n3. Time speed at max speed still feels too slow. Especially early game this can lead to a lot of just sitting on the phone and waiting for income to be able to do anything at all which is not fun.\n4. As of right now there is no event I have come across besides the opening one getting attacked by a rival business/former employer and the annoying rocket ship guys who will ask for a delivery and if you say no they will pester you every 3 minutes. Please add more asap even just defending the drug warehouse from a couple guys with bats or something.\n5. Maybe a send employees home button for when there are fires as closing the shop only keeps customers out and the employees will mindlessly walk into the flame so either I fire them to send them home, waste a limited schedule space to send them home, or let them burn. Please add maybe a fire extinguisher, sprinklers, or a call fire department button maybe? Also adding a send home button would be nice if you need to save some income early on rough days or when accidentally overspending. \n6. Maybe a story about overthrowing other rival businesses that pop up in the neighborhood as you progress by opening your own outlets.\n\nSo far the game has been fun but short as of right now but looking forward to the full release. :)", "timestamp_created": 1687662192, "timestamp_updated": 1687662192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140640111": {"recommendationid": "140640111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141997520", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1745, "last_played": 1688690676}, "language": "english", "review": "I am enjoying the game so far, but there are some things that need to be worked out.\n\nBugs I have found:\n-Employees setting boxes on ground for no reason which leads to contamination\n-Employees not showing up sometimes when you bring up the employee list or employees change order they were in\n-Engineers not fixing the air pressure machine\n-When things go wrong at a business the employees will run away and cry and never go back to work resulting in me having to fire and reconfigure employees all over again, or they die on the lot from starvation if I don't fire them.\n-Achievements for earning money not working\n\nThings to look into:\n-Late game tends to lag \n-It seems that workers don't work as much as they should when they are assigned to work, possibly taking a while for the them to figure out the pathing to objective or \"insert something developer would say here\"\n-Cars around the map all try to cram into one turn lane, sometimes there will be multiple cars clipping into each other\n\nPossible changes:\n-Selling product through phone orders compared to in store doesn't make sense; especially timed orders. \nExample 1---3 star amazonian in store is sold for $495 per box but $1584 for 8 boxes through phone order.\nExample 2---3 star clear in store is sold for $1000 per box but $3600 for 8 boxes through phone order.\nThe math aint mathin on these sales. I know you get a little bit more for timed orders(which should be double or triple since its such a short amount of time) but this needs to change.\n-Lower the cost of appliances. It shouldn't cost $50 per appliance a day to run some heaters/lights/etc. Not so much a problem later in the game but those costs add up when you're riding the struggle bus early game.\n-Tweaks to the monuments. The building that gives you longer work hours could be changed so there is an unlock for 24/7 business operation.\n-Timed missions and phone orders need to be worked out better. Why timed side missions for special customers? They keep asking you to complete the orders anyways after rejecting them so why not just take the timer away.\n-When you buy a piece of land for the factory the price of the next land purchase increases. Could just have every piece of land for the factory be $10,000 a piece. The entire main square would still cost almost $500,000 with that price point.\n-AOE needs to be better for everything. I don't want to put 3+ large heaters/ac units/humidifiers/etc into a small room for the 3 star rating when it should only take 1 or 2 of them.\n-AC/Heater/Lights/Etc should all cap at 100 instead of the different numbers they are currently capped at.

I feel like the game progression in your vision is to Grow Weed -> Cook Meth -> Produce Coke. I propose a concept of choose your end-game where you can flesh out each drug empire as their own path. IF a player wishes, they can dabble in multiple drug trades. However I would find it very interesting if you could get to End-Game while fine-tuning one of the drug trades. \n\nExample: The Cannabis production -  Stretch it out \n\nThe player is able to go from Cannabis to Toasted and Amazonian very quickly and it doesn't take much to get the balance of heat/humidity for 3 Star Product lines. Leaving the next logical path to delve into the Meth trade, but what If it was an option to continue evolving your Cannabis instead of migrating to meth. \n\n4 Progression Trees - \n\n1st Tree is Empire - Works as currently set up where you can progress to each trade and get 3 Instances of Each Product line for 9 options. \n2nd Tree is Grower - Unlocks a 4th and 5th Cannabis types but blocks off the 3rd Instance of Meth/Coke. 9 options\n3rd Tree is Chemist - Unlock a 4th and 5th Meth type but blocks off 3rd Instances of Cannabis/Coke   9 options\n4th Tree is Socialite - Unlocks a 4th and 5th Coke type but blocks off 3rd Instance of Cannabis/Meth   9 options\n\nProgression can work similarly to Junk Yard/Uni/Guns where you send delivery out for skill points but you must purchase upgrades in order. First x amount of points unlocks the choice of a progression tree. The 4th and 5th products of each trade can be more complicated to get the right balance of temperatures/humidity/light (smaller thresholds) \n\nStaff - \n\nI enjoy managing the staff for each establishment but having to adjust the schedule can be tedious, Would love some options to click/drag to change states so we can make a full schedule easier without so much clicking. \n\n\n\n5/5 - This game is awesome for a Early Access game and I very much look forward to more like this!", "timestamp_created": 1687462769, "timestamp_updated": 1687462769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140486954": {"recommendationid": "140486954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820270107", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 654, "last_played": 1688111329}, "language": "english", "review": "Time killer", "timestamp_created": 1687427192, "timestamp_updated": 1687427192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140481142": {"recommendationid": "140481142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127211621", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1167, "last_played": 1693882406}, "language": "english", "review": "Totally legit business simulator", "timestamp_created": 1687416053, "timestamp_updated": 1687416053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140479615": {"recommendationid": "140479615", "author": {"steamid": "76561199022746218", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_at_review": 570, "last_played": 1696035952}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Tycoon game.

Combind with how worthless your vehicles are til upgraded you've got alot of running the game in the background.\n\n2, Nothing ever happens; There's only 2 scripted events in the game where you can even be attacked from what I can tell, both times tied to progress. Both of these attacks are not only completely unwinnable even if every single employee is a guard but there's a entire gameplay mechanic around hiring these guards and outfitting them, which you will never do since even if you could get attacked you don't have the employee limits to maintain any kind of force unless your leaving the game on overnight to afford half a coffee shop.\n\n3, Logistic wise its nonexistant. You can't name routes, or vehicles, or set even the most basic of import limits for them to follow. So lets say you have a donut shop which is selling all 3 kinds of weed, you have space to store 12 of each. If you have 12 of #1, 10#2 and 0 of #3 and the vehicle pulls up with 1 of #1 and you got nowhere to put it, it will sit there forever til space is availible. This creates huge bottlenecks, which lead to workers sitting idle, customers complaining you don't have the right things availible for purchase, ect. \n\n4, AI workers work about 90% of 50% of the time. Your only control over workers is what hours they work, and what tasks and rooms they can be in. You can't prioritize any task over another e.g. Only haul to drivers if you have no Weed #2 related jobs availible, ect you can only say do both and it's random what they'll do. \n\nA good example of this is mechanics who will ignore broken machines (which the game won't tell you why, supposedly theres a 20 tile radius they work in and what that means exactly is never explained) as they wander around randomly even directly past broken equiptment and you can only set room groups for them to work in, so you'd think it would be all the devices in those rooms right? Wrong. \n\n5 Lastly, setting up your actual base is also a pita. There's no options to manually make walls dividing rooms or the like. So in the case of say Weed #2 and Weed #3 having conflicting requirements you'll need to seperate them by building completely superflous rooms with empty land inbetween instead of using a simple divider. Doing this spreads the base out further, which breaks the AI further. Most objects need the area infront of them completely unobstructed and can't share this space, which results in needing huge rooms to tetris objects in despite there being no reason why you can't make a trash can and soda machine can both face the same empty tile.\n\nI could go on about a laundry list of other issues, customer complaints that you can't do anything about decoration (cuz it doesn't exist) or tempature (doesn't affect people), quest's that have absurdly short deadlines that are near impossible to do without express knowledge their about to happen like npc Jack asking for 20 of something in 10 in game minutes (hope you got 3 unused trucks and 4 pallets worth of it ready it's failed with a complete loss of all your stuff), ect ect. \n\nMaybe in couple years of dev this might be worth playing if they completely redo about 2/3 of the systems, but that's gonna be alot of work.", "timestamp_created": 1687163446, "timestamp_updated": 1687163446, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534883737564086914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140315781": {"recommendationid": "140315781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171690226", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 649, "last_played": 1687192385}, "language": "english", "review": "I do reccomend this game but it is extremely lacking in content for the pricetag, I only have 10 hours because I used \"external sources\" to speed up the game because it is genuinly an Idle clicker after 2 or 3 hours in and after that it was just me speeding up the game (I didnt do anything with the \"external sources\" other than speed up the time).

Honestly watch someone play and just look at the U.I. and imagine yourself fumbling through it to get anything done. It's unbearably forgettable and unclear. I had to do the tutorial 2 times just to remember how to put up walls. Then the remove walls and put up walls buttons both highlight for put up walls making it even more confusing, and then sometimes instead of making a room it will delete a room haha.

Navigating from the map, to making your stores, to managing deliveries and scheduling routes/employee hours/open close is really not satisfying.

I can't recommend this in the state its in currently, comparative to say, Satisfactorys EA, this feels like it's in Alpha, and feels borderline unplayable.\n\nWhen I stopped playing last night, I stopped playing bc I had a bug that wouldn't let me place/build anything..

Well that driver will sit in front of the business forever waiting to be unloaded. The UI is clunky and missing some basic features like \"exit to menu\".

I make $100-$200k/day and i have unlocked everything. Hold on, isnt this expected from an Early Access game.....and yes.

If true, this game is not worth the price tag.\n\nI really enjoy the gameplay and concept. Sadly tho, there is no real end game here. Once you start making money there is no real fail scenario. Its an extremely easy game to beat and i really dont see how bringing in cocaine will change this. \n\nThere are almost zero \"events\" and the \"story\" outside the tutorial is basically nonexistent. There is nothing to overcome, no goals, no challenges. Further i have a massive operation, i have 54 factory workers and i produce more drugs than my 10 shops can sell. Even with a massive operation im only using 1/3 of the allowed build space for my factory. There is no need for the rest.

While there are plenty of problems and updates don't come out at a regular pace, I still believe this is worth a buy even at its current state. \n\nWhere this game does right is the idea of building and maintaining both a lab and a front or fronts for your business of NOT selling chicken. Usually you'd only be in charge of procuring and then distributing product, well now you also get to make a KFC to sell less than legitimate products alongside some tasty chicken. This is great and it pleases my simple brain when I do, finally, manage to create a positive cash flow.\n\nWhere this game doesn't quite hit the mark is from a number of ongoing issues. There are a number of bugs that can effectively keep you from playing. Usually these are resolved by relauching the game, but having to do so multiple times per hour can become a real chore. This only becomes more tedious when loading times can be seen as on the long side(I currently have it on an SSD and it still takes a minute or two to get the game launched and back into my current save file.) \n\nLastly, is a certain amount of imbalances in the game itself. At the start the tutorial gives you a rundown of how to start and maintain a business/front. These are relatively charming and simple to understand as you go. However, it has a way of kicking you into the lions den the moment it's over. You help repair and restart a business for another company and the moment you finish the business portion of the tutorial you get fired on the spot. The tutorial takes this chance to introduce you to your very own Sal lawyer guy as the explanation of the Not chicken side of things. The problem with this is the fact that it doesn't set you up for success as soon as they are done feeding you this side of things. You have a barely functioning 'Not chicken' lettuce supply and nothing else, it doesn't urge you to build a business outside of vaguely mentioning the teaching guides on the top before leaving you on your own. \n\nTutorial aside this is the least of your worries at the start. You have only a production of 'lettuce' and no fronts, so now what? Well it gives you access to a group of bikes to deliver product, so that should be enough right? Sadly this is another point for imbalance. Your first orders over the request system is for eight pieces of 'Definitely Not Fried Chicken' each and each job has an output of somewhere between eight and nine hundred dollars. Great! However your starting bikes can only hold one piece of lettuce and makes for horribly slow progress. This becomes only worse when you sell your first piece of lettuce from a front(if you manage to get so far as to start the first of the 'optional' side tutorials) and find that each piece of lettuce sold is worth almost four hundred dollars! So this basically makes any deliveries to these requests completely unprofitable. \n\nTL;DR \n\nWhere this game may have issues and I have a better ability to describe faults than praises due to my own inexperience with other management games like this to compare it to, it still manages to draw me in and peak my interest. I recommend it because it has so much potential and I want nothing more than to see where it goes as the developers put more love and care into it. \n\nAfter thought:\n\nI was made to write this after discovering the strange disconnect between front lettuce money gain and the requests. This was such a huge problem that I had to put it somewhere! Please, developers, this is among your biggest issues that isn't the usual complaint about locked content. The balance between requests and fronts is astronomical and at the beginning the ability to actually survive as nothing but a dealer of 'not fried chicken' without a front is completely impossible without the access to trucks.", "timestamp_created": 1681808045, "timestamp_updated": 1681808045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476917296648025513", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136864554": {"recommendationid": "136864554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090659503", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1681747823}, "language": "english", "review": "Atrocious UI\nVery EA\nNot worth $25\n", "timestamp_created": 1681748064, "timestamp_updated": 1681748064, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531736791133880615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1681807045, "developer_response": "Hello!

I'll explain.\n\nRight now it's two main issues are, lack of content (but there is plenty planned.) and issues with general game logic.\nThe lack of content is pretty much a guaranteed when considering Early Access titles, so I'll give this issue a free pass. However, there needs to be some major changes logic-wise in order for me to turn this frown upside down.\n\nThe building system is, how should I put it, rudimentary at best. There are certain exclusion zones around items that do not need to exist. For example, each tile can only hold one object, the tile adjacent to the object is it's 'interaction zone', you cannot place objects within an interaction zone, or overlap interaction zones. This is a big issue as, for example, doors have an interaction zone on either side. Thus making the building of rooms clunky. You can't, for example, put a door next to a microwave, a UV light (which hangs from the ceiling) over a planter and plenty more other small, yet highly frustrating issues.\n\nThe logistics system is similarly frustrating. If your business fills up on a particular stock, lets say regular cannabis, the car delivering 2 units of Cannabis, 1 unit of Toasted and 1 unit of Amazonian will sit there forever until you eventually sell 2 units of regular Cannabis and the vehicle is now empty. This clogs up the system and is highly inefficient, with larger logistics vehicles planned this will only get worse. \nWhat it should do is make a check to see if the assigned stores are full and if so, return to the depot or go to the next delivery assignment. Better yet, have the store check for what it needs and make the request from the factory to begin with.\n\nWorkers need a priority list of assignments. If there are customers waiting to be served and a logistics vehicle waiting to be emptied and you only have limited employees, the player should be able to decide which they want to tackle first. Rather than have to employ far more employees than necessary to cover all bases at all times. Just as with the logistics, this is highly inefficient.\n\nRight now, I cannot recommend this game. Within a few hours I've pretty much seen all there is to see and spotted a few major issues that will grind the game down as more content is added. As far as the gameplay loop is concerned, it's great. It just needs a lot more mechanical refinement and about another year or two in the oven before it's ready.

The rest is locked away in early access hahaha! The game at its core is pretty fun. By setting up the fried chicken business you get to feel like you're the boss of Los Pollos Hermanos. Other than that, the delivery of product needs a lot of work. If not micromanaged, the products will get delivered to the wrong store. There is a garage indicator on the map but it doesn't show which is a car or a moped right until it leaves out for delivery. Workers may stop working, the UI is basic and pretty straight forward. Doesn't take too long getting used to it. Graphics are okay as the main focus is production and delivery of products to your customers and how you can improvise and create a better and faster production line. I feel it should be more that just 4 worker slot for each plot purchased to produce your products. \n\nThere are a lot of improvements to be made to this game and I hope the devs will deliver the rest of the early access content soon and make more interesting content for the game.

However there are a few bugs that make it almost unplayable later on:\n-  the employees of the three available businesses are not able to serve clients, which stay in queue infinitely\n- after you fire a worker and he does not display anymore in the list of workers of a business, he won't go home, just walk around the shop with the task \"going home\". That means that the total number of workers will not decrease, leaving the player with an even smaller availability of workers.\n- deleting a shift schedule results sometimes in not being able to reassign workers at a different one or fire them. the game will automatically set them with a $700 a day salary and they will not do any task\n- workers of the drug factory will not work after you reassign them to another task\n\nalso please add the possibility for workers of the drug factory to sleep. They are always tired and drop the products on the floor to go to sleep.\nAlso the feature to name and reorder the list of employees will be a nice feature, maybe adding a small preview of how they look and what clothes they are wearing could be a nice idea to make the game more intuitive.\nadd the possibility for the cars to automatically collect the product required for deliveries and stop giving away what for free what the deliver doesn\u2019t ask for or what has already been satisfied\n\nI\u2019m sorry for my bad english, I know the developers will do wonders with this game!\n", "timestamp_created": 1675597258, "timestamp_updated": 1675597258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132250579": {"recommendationid": "132250579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309720305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1893, "last_played": 1675592795}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has potential, but it has a ton of bug for now.

Many issues need fixing. Not worth the price AT THE MOMENT.\n\nReview: After spending a decent amount of time in this game, in it's current state I can't recommend buying it. Too much needs to be done.\nIssues: \n* Character AI is terrible. Nothing worse than people you are paying to do a job standing around. (They are fixing this as a priority)\n* Monuments do not work (known issue, added to the list)\n* \"upgraded\" equipment does not offer any additional benefit (known issue)\n* Delivery path finding needs work. Time sensitive deliveries and my drivers are doing circles around the block.\n* two \"employees\" per purchase of production land is just not enough, needs re-balancing / increasing or have security personnel as it's own capacity and separated from workers.\n\nTechnical issues:\n* Poorly optimised. Once your empire is \"big\" then game performance just tanks.\n* After a relatively decent amount of playtime it chews through my RAM, using in excess of 10GB\n* Random crashes, usually jumping from owned properties/fronts via the menu icon. (Save often)\n* UI elements just stop working and are unresponsive randomly. Character equipment sheet and interacting with placeable objects mainly.\n\nAll this is known to the devs and I'm sure there are other issues I just have not raised.\n\nNote to devs: Please change the default settings for any object that can be \"filtered\" for accepted items to nothing (default is set to accept EVERYTHING) upon placement rather it would be better to let me filter manually after placement. examples include: Storage shelves, delivery vehicles, processing equipment.  There is nothing more annoying than trying to add storage/delivery route for meth (or other products) and your workers charge in with hands full of everything else and start throwing it on a shelf. This is a QoL improvement that in my opinion is just needed.\n\nOverall, when this game has had some more work and optimisation done to it, it will be a very chill, fun game. I will revisit this in the future and if they fix the issues I will change my recommendation but for now I cannot recommend it.

You can totally play this game \"legally\" without starting the grow op, which adds a different dynamic to the game IMO.", "timestamp_created": 1674843352, "timestamp_updated": 1674843352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131662395": {"recommendationid": "131662395", "author": {"steamid": "76561199099357249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 423, "playtime_at_review": 483, "last_played": 1696104256}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun Game but needs some ARBEIT", "timestamp_created": 1674836877, "timestamp_updated": 1674836877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131649208": {"recommendationid": "131649208", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997898630", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 8018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5787, "last_played": 1684587696}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth it, even in EA.", "timestamp_created": 1674822243, "timestamp_updated": 1674822243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131640104": {"recommendationid": "131640104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283612558", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 527, "last_played": 1690915651}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a very fun game, can't wait for more updates!", "timestamp_created": 1674808728, "timestamp_updated": 1674808728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519230782985687256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131635577": {"recommendationid": "131635577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011032466", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "playtime_at_review": 922, "last_played": 1696035735}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes if you're patient and don't mind a hard learning curve.

Well, they did that but with people\u201d - Dev\n\nAll my game time so far has been on the steam deck, so first of all, the games aesthetic is fitting and well done, it has that 80\u2019s vibe as advertised. I\u2019m not sure where the dev is from, but back in the 80\u2019s we used to have these coffee/hot chocolate machines that look exactly like one of the drink machines in DNFC. I keep one in my drug factory kitchen, makes me smile every time I see it, reminds me of those sweet molten hot-hot chocolates at a hockey game/practice.\n\nAnother thing I really enjoy is the almost perfect balance of micromanagement and idler type of gameplay, there is just the right amount of mix, the drug making randos  require little input in to what they do, and more emphasis is placed on fine tuning your operations to find the right schedules, planning workflow, etc to get the most efficient operation as possible.\n\nHowever one thing I find the game lacks, for me anyway, would be an optional \u201crefinement method\u201d. For instance with weed, I think something like adding curing as an optional process, having a curing station which would take additional time at a slower progress rate. Jar up the weed, let it sit for some time and add a \u201cTop Shelf\u201d quality level, or even a nutrient mix station which depending on your nutrient mix could make the plant grow mutant huge, crazy fast, double harvest amount. \n\nOne major flaw I find at this point in the game would be I find the UI a tad clunky and unintuitive, but this is EA and I\u2019m sure there are QOL and UI refinements in the future so this really isn\u2019t a dealbreaker in my books. My other gripes are largely related to a few bugs, but again, not a dealbreaker for me.\n\nOne bug I found that made me giggle for hours was when one of my gardeners glitched up and he had a watering can stuck in his hand constantly spraying water, spraying water in bed, spraying water as he was being sprayed by water in the shower, eating meals, it was hilarious, everywhere this man went, he was spraying water, some say he still sprays water constantly to this day!\n\nThe game has only crashed on me once so far, and it was a really hard crash, frame rate plummeted and locked up my steam deck, so I had to get out of my lazy-boy to reset my Gaben deck, and this made me angry, until it didn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m really hoping there will be more music added, while I like the music, I need a bit more variety.\n\nOverall I really enjoy the game, yea the asking price as the game sits is a bit steep, but as a fan of tycoon games, I\u2019ve spent more for less for sure. I like the fact the people in the game are grown in boxes on the ground in Japan like the watermelons, the game has some deep lore.\n\nSo easy buy for me, I hope the dev keeps going strong, as I\u2019m excited to watch this game grow!", "timestamp_created": 1674685937, "timestamp_updated": 1674686343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131542616": {"recommendationid": "131542616", "author": {"steamid": "76561199225579906", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1024, "last_played": 1677526957}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game definitely recommend to anyone that enjoy playing this genre of game", "timestamp_created": 1674673091, "timestamp_updated": 1675280059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131537917": {"recommendationid": "131537917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007411910", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1675026054}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game now with a big potential and lots of rough edges in it's current state. Now I have only played 2 hours so far but I can get an idea about a game from that. It's more indepth and engaging than I thought it would be. The \"clucky\" graphics you barely even notice after 15 minutes.  Some things that need work. It would be fun if you could name your toons. Maybe you can but I didn't notice if you could. The toons don't seem to upgrade their skills. Which seems an obvious thing to do but maybe I didn't get far enough into the game yet? The tutorial is crap. To be honest, the things it explained well I could either figure out for myself or knew from other games. Or the things I didn't, often the tutorial more confused me than helped me.  It can be confusing to figure out what the hell they are saying to do. Several times I did what I thought was right but the tutorial wouldn't forward until I \"randomly\" tried other things. If you do something in the tutorial before it asks you to do it, you have to undo that thing and redo it for the tutorial to register that you did it. Several times when it did forward, I got a black screen with a movable cursor that made me have to start over again. And one time the tutorial just would not forward to the next part no matter what I did. And I clicked on every possible thing I could have. I just got a arrow point to something to click on and when I clicked on that button a new screen came up with another arrow. I click on that button and it takes me back to the first screen. Rinse and repeat. But none of these things seem to happen in the actual game. And I just skipped by the tutorial after awhile and was pretty much fine.\n\nSome BIG annoying things in game is 1. you build these rooms with nice thick walls. But the toons don't respect the walls at all. They more often than not walk right through them. And when they don't walk through them they don't always take the quickest way to where they need to go. 2. If you build a room and decide to expand it later, the ground dosn't seem to expand with the room. In other words, what passes as dirt in the game stays as dirt for the floor and one room seems to have kept the original walls from the first build of the room but they don't affect the toon going to the new area. 3. When you first start the game, the main bad guy just sends a few of his overpowered troops to your place and wipes out everybody and everything. Now you have to rehire and get an engineer to fix everything. Why? It looks cute but more annoying than cute. 4. I really don't like having to hold the scroll wheel as you move the mouse to move around the screen and the right button to turn. It seems to me that should be reversed if anything. Having basically skipped most of the tutorial, or maybe I really didn't because there is no hint at all that there was much more to it than I saw, I found myself unable to figure out how to upgrade the quality of my products. I.E. make better pot. It clearly says you can and I know putting lights in helps do this but they don't seem to be doing it so far. The first crop or two is high quality but after that it's all trash. Even with the lights. It says certain things affect the quality but it really dosn't say what things you need to use to affect what or what the crop needs to be better quality. How does buying a \"front\" business help me? I know why in real life but not in game. And a few other things. Also, there seems to be some sort of point system that when you get enough points it unlocks more items to use. I have no idea how that works but I seem to be getting points some how.

Fewer bugs overall, but it felt like I needed to restart the game more to get rid of some little issue than I remember. New content, but I didn't have the time to put in to get through the early game to try it. The time speed in this game seems a bit slow, and doing most things takes significant time and investment with often small margins for error. I would like to see some sort of a planning mode that works with the overlays, or at least the ability to sell purchased equipment within a short timeframe for the same price it's bough for, because figuring out ideal layouts can be tricky and take some trial and error. It sucks to have to eat the cost because the game doesn't give you a way to work it out without spending money.\n\nOverall, still the same sentiment: I currently would only recommend this to people who really enjoy management style games who are willing to support an unfinished game that shows potential.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nVery Early Access, but a very good concept and it could be a great end product. I plan to update this review as the game develops. For now it is a recommend with caveats.\n\nIt's buggy right now and a large chunk of planned content isn't implemented yet, so don't buy if you're looking for a polished experience. That said, the bones of a good game are here, and I'm excited to see how this game evolves. I was excited to restart as I learned ways to make my operation more profitable or efficient, and the systems are engaging and complex enough that every run felt (and ended) different. \n\nLogistics plays a large role in everything on both a micro and macro scale. The distance between your workstations, the lengths of your hallways, and even the path your trucks must take to reach other destinations is something you'll want to keep in mind. I find that challenge stimulating, though I would like to see some further development. The ability to set task priorities for workers, box and ship intermediate production items (like uncooked donuts, for example), and the ability to set custom routes for transports would be great. To go from great to incredible would be implementing rotating availability of a larger number of purchasable properties and logistic hubs like warehouses or garages to allow for more complex supply chains.\n\nThis game has plenty of positives, but I currently would only recommend this to people who really enjoy management style games who are willing to support an unfinished game that shows potential. Some of the bugs currently being worked on should have been found with just regular play testing before release, there were some choices that felt like they were the result of a rushed release, and this game is too new to know for sure how the devs will progress, but I'm rooting for this game and I think it could be great.", "timestamp_created": 1674592850, "timestamp_updated": 1682443263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131484067": {"recommendationid": "131484067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409612320", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1684169196}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it", "timestamp_created": 1674592358, "timestamp_updated": 1674592358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131482258": {"recommendationid": "131482258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057354413", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1674903751}, "language": "english", "review": "seems promising will keep it and wait for some more improving updates but so far makes fun!", "timestamp_created": 1674590253, "timestamp_updated": 1674590253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131476429": {"recommendationid": "131476429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097621752", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 537, "last_played": 1674591312}, "language": "english", "review": "Be Aware it has major bugs, which might destroy your pleasure while playing it, but ... besides that it's amazing game!\nIt's a great tycoon of legit & criminal business with great balance so far.

I've been following this game for a year or 2 and was excited to see it finally out.  I normally don't have a problem with EA games and still can find some fun in them, but this game makes it hard to.\n\nFirst off, it's the same ol' tale that you are seeing on reviews for this game: Tutorial sucks.  It really sucks.  It has you do the bare minimum and then just...stops.  I can't really say it just \"stops.\"  More like that common movie trope where the dying old man is about you tell you the biggest secret in the whole universe but just gasps and dies.  Like Yoda, about to tell Luke about Vader, but just disappears into thin air.  Yeah, that's how this tutorial works out. \n\n\nLike others have said, Time is slow and I wish they fully explained it so I will.  Unlike games like the Sims, Two Point series, Planet Coaster/Zoo, when you hit the fast forward buttons, time moves very fast.  This game's option is normal, normalish, normallishish. See, you need to make deliveries to get paid, but the city is rather large and it takes quite a while to make a delivery.  Not to mention, each delivery requires 7 drop offs to get paid (which, btw, the tutorial never talks about). Clicking on the fastest option doesn't really help a thing.  I'm not asking to skip an entire day but can we have a sense of urgency?\n\nThen there are several upgrades and items that have literal \"EA\" on them. I mean, that is expected in an Early Access title.\n\n\nIf for some reason you still want to get this game I have to tell you, be prepared to start a new game a few times until you can figure this mess out.  However, and this drives me crazy, if you need to start a new game, the only option you have is to exit out of the whole game, open the game up again in Steam and then choose a new game. There is no way to \"Exit to Main Menu.\"  I don't understand how basic menu features are none existent in this game that allows you to have multiple saves.  \n\nI love management games and this one is unique and right up my alley.  However, they decided to be a little too unique with their strange design choices, that I can't recommend this game AS IS.  I can see this game being better in 6 months and even \"Great\" by the time it leaves Early Access.  Devs have already been acknowledging a lot of the bugs and hopefully some QOL.  As for now, wait a bit.\n\n[h1]UPDATED REVIEW:[/h1] \n\nSo, I've added several hours to this game but don't let that you fool you.  In order to get a good chunk of money going, I highly recommend letting the game run as you go do chores/work/errands and etc.  With more money in the bank you'll be able to explore more about the game.  In doing so, I have found out more things I dislike about this game:\n\nThings that have AOE (Area of Effect) are pretty trash in this game right now.  There are certain conditions that need to be met in order to grow a high quality drug such as temperature and light.  You have basic UV lights, heaters, AC and etc.  You can also get upgrade these things like Over Head Grow lights or Large Heaters but they pretty much suck/useless.  You'd think you'd be able to put overhead lights, well, overhead your plants.  You can't.  You figure that putting a Large Heater, right in front of your product would be sufficient enough.  Wrong.  You put it at a specific angle that doesn't make any sense.  \n\nEmployees at your restaurants are constantly dropping things.  I've seen 3 year olds with iron like grips compared to these but wholes. I've once watched an employee pick up and drop the same burger 4 times in a row, leave it, then eventually come back before dropping it 2 more times. The worst part is, when they drop the food it becomes contaminated and will make customers sick who will eventually die (luckily there is no penalty for this...yet).  There is no way to get rid of the contaminated food.  You can't even put a garbage can in the kitchen for these but wholes to just throw it away.  \n\nEmployees also seem to have a mind of their own and will outright refuse to do tasks that YOU have told them to do.  For some reason, my employees really hate making glazed donuts, even though they are tasked to do it, and the glazed donuts have their very own station and dedicated fryer and they refuse to make it.  You can fire employees but  I really hope they eventually add in the ability to just kill off these useless employees.\n\nWho also thought it was a great idea to make the burger fryer a special but-whole unit that must have a heater next to it or else it will explode?  If you do not maintain this thing with a heater (awkwardly placed, taking up valuable space) and maintenance man, it will explode and set your whole kitchen on fire.  \n\nGame crashes at the weirdest times too.  \"Oh, whats that?  You wanted to check on your employee's condition?\" Crash. \"Oh, you like saving because I'm in EA?\" Crash. \"Oh, that youtube video you were watching went into a commercial break?\" Crash! (This literally happened last night to me).\n\nThis is really tough for me.

The mopeds and cars are a great idea, but the problem is that it's pretty tedious and difficult to see at a glance what is happening logistically.  \n\nAs an example, you get calls in the neighborhood requesting your goods.  You have to assign vehicles you own to take the goods to the location.  This is fine at first, but it quickly becomes obvious that there will be a lot of these requests and you'll have to be going into the dispatch screen to just tell your cars to go to a bunch of places.  I think this detracts from the game a good bit.\n\nAlso, there's not really a good way to distribute goods efficiently to the other businesses you own.  Cars get sent to locations regardless of how full the local storage is, meaning they could just be sitting overnight (since inventory is static at night) and only keep doing the rounds late in the morning.  Distribution could be automatic--stores request goods they want--or you could make a new job \"the dispatcher\" to handle those logistics.  Either way, the logistics are not great.\n\nI think the limit on factory workers based on plots owned doesn't make a lot of sense and it's a little unbalanced.  At the current setting, I don't see a way to defend my factory and still produce.  Maybe this was intentional since attacks don't yet seem to be a thing.\n\nStill some buggy things but overall, very nice little game.", "timestamp_created": 1674424022, "timestamp_updated": 1674424022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131366034": {"recommendationid": "131366034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277180056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 724, "last_played": 1675128360}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet:\nI absolutely love this game and its something I can see myself building upon for a while but in its current state of not loading saves with meth past 75% , I cant recommend it.\n\nAny time I get to a point in my save where I start manufacturing meth, my save files wont load past 75%.\nThis has happened twice and at the current time I don't feel like restarting again, I'm just super bummed.\nUntil they fix this error I cant recommend this game.

Tons of bugs in this game. So if you are on the fence let me say two things. \n1) The game is missing a ton of content and nothing like the videos they post to sell this game. The videos also show items that are not in the EA which is deceptive to those buying.\n2) The game will randomly die and crash at any moment. People complain about crashing. This has never happened to me. But the AI will bug out randomly. \n\nPROs\n-------- \n-- The Idea is great if done correct\n-- I like the look of the game\n-- Alot of potential\n\nCONS\n--------\n-- Tons of problems. Cleaners get stuck alot. The AI has so many issues that its hard to believe the game was released. The people playing this EA failed the programmers badly.\n-- Only thing you can make is 3 Pots and cloudy Meth. Everything else is missing.\n-- Only stores you can make is Laundry mat and doughnut store. Not sure if Chicken Shop is possible. Doughnut store is extremely buggy.\n-- After 30 hours you seem to make more money making 3star cheap pot. Not much depth.\n--- Way too many CONS to post.\n\nOne game I got attacked by the Mayor. Next game I created 4 guards and no attacks after 10 hours of play.\nOVERALL - Tons of problems and tons of missing content. But maybe worth the wait. So far I find myself playing a ton just to see how fast I can make cash. For some reason this has gotten entertaining and addictive. \n\nADDED: Since Tom Merge responded and will hopefully read this.

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.\nEventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared.

[I] [/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nI admit, this one drove me up the wall. Look, I get that games may be a little rough in early access, and I try to keep an open mind when it comes to the gameplay to give updates. I know that a simulation genre is also one that it's a little bit tricky to do in early access: with multiple mechanics to refine and to mess with. But the first impression that Definitely Not Fried Chicken made with me was bad: and seem to frustrate me at every turn. Whether it being missing elements to snap back to our main area, confusing icons, or just not giving enough of a tutorial on certain things, all I could think was about other games like it that wouldn't be frustrating me as much as this one was.\n\nI mean look, if your employees literally are at 0 food or hygiene, and you can't specifically tell them to do that task, I expect the AI to be like \u201coh, I'm going to die. I probably should deal with this.\u201d Instead, they went and watched TV. Like that's the kind of things that frustrated me through the game, whether it be apparently being able to build over my area with a road that I definitely didn't want, or having items take up way too much space on the playable area (why do I need two spaces for a wall dryer?!?). Frustrating controls aside: you don't even really get into the front part of the game until a bit later, and a rea at that point, you're just wanting to stab yourself to remove yourself from the experience.\n\nLike, maybe it'll build into a game worth something down the road. But right now, I have no confidence in the base product because there's so many problems left and right. \n\n\n[b]Stream Footage:    [/b]  https://youtu.be/aIaRlLtjpgY\n\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] A bit of mechanics. \n[*] Some ok visuals. \n [/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The pace of the mechanics is so fast and so many, that you can't keep track of everything when the game lets go and you get confused.\n[*] The game's tutorial teaches you some mechanics....but not others. And then sorta makes you try to figure out things on the way.\n[*] UI at times is frustrating to get through and keybinds for things you'd figure that you'd want (go to the base of your operation for example) aren't here.\n[*] The game feels overly complex in certain areas (the schedule for example) that maybe should have waited to be introduced down the road.\n[*] The worker AI will literally let itself be killed even if you literally try to tell it \u201chey, take the time you need, get yourself well.\u201d It will ignore things like a shower and will watch TV instead if that one is semi-low, oh by the way YOU DIED DURING THAT TIME.\n[*] Glitches like values staying on your mouse or people going through walls are common. \n[*] The game takes a LONG time to load the first time around....on a machine that can games with 25x complexity in an instant. \n[*] Just frustrating.\n [/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

But the game isn't perfect and it's definitely got problems. I'm only giving it a thumbs up because there's no middle ground neutral button and I don't think it deserves a thumbs down.\n\nTechnically the game does what it sets out to do. It's a simulator game about drug peddling. The management is decent, the gameplay is sufficient and the loop is kinda fun and addictive. So because it does those fairly well it gets a thumbs up.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThe game is broken to the point it almost crashed my PC half a dozen times. No i'm not exaggerating. During it's loading screen it freezes at minimal twice per loading screen and almost crashes every time.\n\nThen you've got certain functions simply not working. Game asked me to place a break room. I tried but nothing happened but the game still thought that it was built so it wanted me to continue doing the tutorial, only I couldn't. \n\nSo the game is still very unstable and honestly every time I try to open up the game I get nervous that it's going to destroy my PC.\n\nPlus the game is very unfinished, missing a lot of content which I suppose makes sense because it's early access but still I thought I should say so.\n\nAnd then you've got some functions of the gameplay that are downright poorly designed and need to be adjusted. Like the delivering of your goods to yoru customers. They take one box at a time, it's super slow and half the time you'll find yourself just staring at your screen for 5-10 minutes just waiting for orders to be completed while you're depleting money the whole time. The delivery needs to be sped up somehow or something I don't know but it needs to be more engaging then that.\n\nAlso I don't think that the pricetag is appropriate for this kind of game. Pixelated graphics. No voice acting. Generic sound effects. Repetetive gameplay loop.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a bad game, but I still think that the price tag is a bit too much for an investment. They are making us pay them to playtest their game and I think it's too much.\n\nIf you'd like a more in depth look at the game with more information then please check out the video I posted on my YouTube Channel.
