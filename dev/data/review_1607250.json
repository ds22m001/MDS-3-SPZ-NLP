[/h2]\n\nThe assets [u]heavily[/u] borrow from the My Hero Fighting Game, which are vibrant and fun (especially if you're a fan of the anime) meaning you can pick up one of the hero's / villains you love most in the show and use their iconic abilities. The skeleton/ framework of the game feels to me like a near copy of the Naruto: Shinobi Striker game. So this is a mashup of those two [b] with all of the pro's and con's of both [/b].\n\nThe abilities look and feel powerful for most characters, meaning you can hop back and forth between different characters and mess around with play styles. I've enjoyed the speed based characters the most (Ochaco, Froppy and Ida) as they feel the most unique in using terrain to their advantage. \n\nAlthough the abilities look wonderful in the cell shaded style they feel quite heavy and can take up a lot of the screen leading you to easily get yourself lost in a fight with another team. In addition. you'll find that if you've had your shield broken by two abilities/ attacks that you'll be getting knocked over constantly. The evade window works in a 1v1 setting, but, in this 3v3 game-mode dodging (using Ctrl as default) feels absolutely pointless. \n\nMenu-ing is atrocious, honestly some of the worst I've seen in a multiplayer game, it feels un-intuitive and screens are never as easy to access as you'd like. Why can't you unlock characters in the shop, why do some menu icons feel like they need to be clicked twice to access and why is readying up in a small box to the left instead of underneath your character?\n\nMonetisation what you can expect from a standard free-to-play gacha game. I've counted 4 main currencies as well as 3 others that unlock items in the \"gallery\"? Horrible way to pad out timed challenges and battle passes. On top of this, [b] locking characters behind a paywall [/b] will inevitably lead to a toxic Pay2Win environment with some characters being stronger than others, regardless of skill. \n\nThe devs have counteracted this by giving new users access to one character ticket to unlock whoever you'd like which is a good start, but I doubt it'll help the longevity of the game.  \n\n[h3] Here's what I'd like to see improved [/h3]\n- Abilities being on a decent cool down leading to fights needing to rely more on melee and the dodge mechanic\n- Much simpler menu's \n- More Game mode's (including solo and team based objectives)\n- Revive's easier to collect (one ticket rather than three) but are more visible and longer to cast.\n- Plus Ultra having a kind of Ultimate/ Super attack as at the minute it feels lack luster\n- Objectives other than box opening and rescuing \n\nA Solid 5/10, will keep my eye on it over the coming months.", "timestamp_created": 1696099907, "timestamp_updated": 1696100027, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147378488": {"recommendationid": "147378488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400242782", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 597, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1696101805}, "language": "english", "review": "aa", "timestamp_created": 1696099744, "timestamp_updated": 1696099744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492091387510299683", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147378388": {"recommendationid": "147378388", "author": {"steamid": "76561199006860976", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 364, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1696102565}, "language": "english", "review": "Nope", "timestamp_created": 1696099669, "timestamp_updated": 1696099669, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147378215": {"recommendationid": "147378215", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079804761", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 178, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1696099236}, "language": "english", "review": "Horrible servers -

The overall game play is very fluid. Your objective is clear and how to accomplish it even clearer. There is a lootbox system to get free cosmetics and if you roll duplicates you get rewarded with another currency to buy MORE cosmetics. The only down side to this game I would have to say is the way you unlock characters Such as Froppy, Bakugo, Todoroki, Mr. Compress and All Might. You have a separate leveling system aside from your account level and License Level(BP). And it takes a very long time just to scrape from Level 0 to 1. Then it becomes a little easier and XP feels as if its coming in larger quantities. But other than that the way the game works, the mechanics, the characters and the cosmetics are 10/10. I suggest installing it if you are a first-timer and try playing about 10 games of UNRANKED. Oh right! There is also a ranked mode for those competitive souls among us! You get to climb through the ranks of Beginner, Amateur, Pro, and Ace. But anyways. Install the game. Get your cosmetics and play about 10 games to really get a feel for it.

I got Toga, Compress, gundam speed boy, Bakugo, and vine girl within 12 hours of play. The game gives you a lot of crystals at the start that you can dump into leveling up the special licence which really helps out. They give you 4 free ten pulls at the start. And if you create a agency or join one. You can level up your gym and get crazyyyy exp boosts that also help with leveling your special licence to unlock characters faster. I am already at level 32 and have cleared most of the event rewards, completed all the weekly, etc. 2 - 3 games a day finishes all your dailies. And yes, you can also test out characters you want to play before unlocking them. A lot of the free choices are really nice. Especially Dabi who I have won countless games with now. ITS NOT THAT BAD.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Rewards for challenges are dog shit. You get like.. 3 pulls a week from doing them. Gotcha games on mobile have better drops than that.\n- The skins in this game are dog shit. If you want us to spend money to keep this game up. Make some better skins besides recolors that look like they belong in the 90s. I am a 3d artist, so I know texture editing is really simple. Charging people for texture edits is ludicrous. \n- Lower the pity rate. 200 pulls for a pity is rough when the diamond rate is so terribly low and most people, like me, use those beginner diamonds to level up their special licence to unlock meta characters instead of wasting them on a banner with 3 mediocre characters. Put it at 100. \n- Can't bend over emote with mount lady in giant form. Smh\n- Player base on PC is dwindling. The first day, it was really fast to find and play a match. Now it takes at least 10 minutes to load in. Compress your servers. Having too many is causing the connection errors we are having and the maintenance from yesterday. Too many is making things take too long and breaking shit.\n- Maps are really small and the circle moves way too fast. Increase the map size, make new maps, or at least cut the time on the circle by at least 30%.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the game has only been out for 2 days. ITS REALLY FUN FOR WHAT IT IS.

(eg: deku is assault. he finds all might card. his quirk level up.) \nrating.: coming from apex, this game is competitive, just needs to fix the character unlock system, gacha rates, balance out some characters. the outplay potential isnt really there, as most combos end with just one skill so it feels very limited with the skill expression. let me hit the naraka combos pls. 7/10.",

From rolling you can get 3 characters, They're all great but easily replaceable by their early game counterparts.\n\nVisuals - Wasn't expecting alot since this game was built up from used assests, but for a F2P game, It looks quite good, some of the animations can be wonky but I can't complain. Hopefully they'll add a new map for rotation sometime in the future since the current one can get quite repetitive.\n\nGameplay - Very team-based, It's nearly impossible to beat a team of 3 without your own team, The role system is something that I could still try messing with more due to the effects stacking, such as +3 Rapid buffs. The spawning system isn't bad and I like the simplicity of it, could do with a ground format for inner structures instead of spawning through holes. The looting is nearly perfect in my opinion, And the Mega boxes that drop are definitely a game changer, I wish there was a bonus for when you picked up your own character's ability card, like an extra upgrade, but I can't complain. Zones are a staple in every battle royal and this game does them decently well, and I can imagine some future characters interacting with it in some ways that are unique. I think the Down state is done well, and they clearly thought about the Team focus alot more then other Battle royals, the abilities linked to reviving are a good idea but the it's not really unique, all of them involve a barrier covering the enemy or moving them, I'd like to see a revive where it restores shield or upgrades abilities.\n\nCombat - Most of the time, I forget I have a basic combo string. You always have a move off CD, and in the later games, why would you do a basic combo when you have 3 maxed out abilities to spam? And there's barely any benefit to comboing since barely any characters have combo string, best example being Lida, but even then his combos are wonky and barely work. The current meta characters are all strong due to their Strong range spam moves, like Deku and Bakugo which decreases the usability of characters with no way to fight them, Kendo has been redundant since her release due to her lack of range and her almost useless Special ability, I do think the Combat is fun, just not fair.\n\nConclusion - It's F2P, get it and see for yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1696087757, "timestamp_updated": 1696087757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147364295": {"recommendationid": "147364295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198873711254", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 949, "playtime_at_review": 791, "last_played": 1696106336}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game", "timestamp_created": 1696087448, "timestamp_updated": 1696087448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147364265": {"recommendationid": "147364265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083292504", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 338, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1696089391}, "language": "english", "review": "- always got disconnected\n- long match making\n- too many connection problem\n- can't even login\n- always got \" NETWORK ERROR OCCURRED \" problem", "timestamp_created": 1696087417, "timestamp_updated": 1696087530, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147364193": {"recommendationid": "147364193", "author": {"steamid": "76561199012023263", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 550, "playtime_at_review": 479, "last_played": 1696100985}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a pretty fun battle royale game", "timestamp_created": 1696087370, "timestamp_updated": 1696087370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147364152": {"recommendationid": "147364152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069353939", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 318, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1696087245}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm just gonna leave a thumb down here until they fix the network error issue", "timestamp_created": 1696087339, "timestamp_updated": 1696087339, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147364150": {"recommendationid": "147364150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258482605", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1696087229}, "language": "english", "review": "Your connection was interrupted.

Its pretty fun if a bit janky and the gameplay is quite good. There is a gacha but its only there to unlock costumes and like 3 characters. The rest can be unlocked with either grinding to get through the special pass or using the premium currency to level up quickly on that pass. I do believe anyone that says that characters can only be recieved through the gacha has either not played the game.

Totally ignoring the poor F2P earn rate, there's several currencies I literally don't know where in the client to spend them. If you want to pay money to unlock a character, you can't really, you have to filter it through like three sub currencies before eventually getting gatcha tickets that convert into two other currencies that are what you use to buy characters, and one of those routes is like 30% less efficient than the other for no reason. It's worse than mobile games I've seen which is wild. Like there's a difference between \"Obtuse to conceptually separate game currencies and real money\" and \"Outright confusing and difficult to interact with\". I get why a game might have miserable F2P progression, but there's no reason it should be so bizarrely difficult to pay money to unlock a specific character.\n\nI'm hoping they just gut the economy entirely and replace it something that's less of a mess, it's a drag that such a good idea for a game is bogged down by a horrendous rats nest of an economy, I don't think I can recommend it while it's in this state.", "timestamp_created": 1696057129, "timestamp_updated": 1696057129, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147335154": {"recommendationid": "147335154", "author": {"steamid": "76561199105999856", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1696056954}, "language": "english", "review": "all i did was do the tutorial then it took me in a game and the game just ended then it took me back to the tutorial what kind of dog s*** game is this?", "timestamp_created": 1696057099, "timestamp_updated": 1696057159, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147335084": {"recommendationid": "147335084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198993924829", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 584, "playtime_at_review": 584, "last_played": 1696056929}, "language": "english", "review": "They say everything is behind a pay wall witch is not true, you can spend money to get it sooner or you can level up and do challenges for the characters. overall good game.", "timestamp_created": 1696057010, "timestamp_updated": 1696057010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147335064": {"recommendationid": "147335064", "author": {"steamid": "76561199165751246", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 366, "playtime_at_review": 342, "last_played": 1696058470}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty fun when u find ur character ngl", "timestamp_created": 1696056986, "timestamp_updated": 1696056986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147335061": {"recommendationid": "147335061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254632925", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1696057389}, "language": "english", "review": "better than warzone", "timestamp_created": 1696056983, "timestamp_updated": 1696056983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147335052": {"recommendationid": "147335052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022679039", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 466, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1696070273}, "language": "english", "review": "Game's fun but the connection issues are horrendous.

First off, for a game that incorporates third-person shooting mechanics, the FOV is so zoomed in on your character that it's hard to aim but even harder to tell where the heck you're being shot at from. The hitboxes are bad, I'll watch shots from me and teammates go right through someone completely and get no damage but they'll do an area of effect move that I'm way out of reach for and still, I somehow get hit. \n\nI'm not sure if it would've been balanced because of all of the character ability differences but it sucks that there's no duos or solo-play mode and that its always got to be teams of three, matchmaking takes forever, and then when I load in I am usually the first one to die while my teammates are literally standing next to me at full health and guard points and either do nothing or start to run away. Maybe the experience could be a little bit better if I had two friends to party with consistently and have voice chat communication but it's hard to convince a friend to play this when the game play is so bad.\n\nThe menus are so confusing that I have no idea what is going on, I notice in the character select menu some characters have a lock symbol and say to use them you have to use this little card emblem thing which it says I have 3/3 of but it doesn't explain what that emblem is? Is it limited? Can I get more of it? Does it refresh every day back to 3 or maybe every few hours? and if I use one does that unlock that character permanently or just for that single game? I never seen anything that explains this. Some people said the characters were locked behind loot boxes I went through all the menus and couldn't even see anywhere to purchase them so at this point I don't even know.\n\nThis game is just meh, not saying it can't be enjoyed to some degree, but it's worse than Jump Force so I'm about certain that if Bandai canned the servers for that so soon, then this will probably be no different at that rate.", "timestamp_created": 1696042815, "timestamp_updated": 1696042815, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147324806": {"recommendationid": "147324806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194570626", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 592, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1696071850}, "language": "english", "review": "People keep harping about the microtransactions but consider something like Apex legends, that game locks way more of their characters behind grinding or paywalls.

game or a battle royale and its so jarringly unfun\n\nno real interesting combos or depth in combat its just a mash fest, damage is so high it feels like why even care about your ability rotation, you can barely cancel your abilities, if at all, whats the point?\n\nthese controls were invented for people with 16 fingers, why not just copy how any other game did it, why am I moving with WASD and doing a punch combo with V? your 'primary fire', 'shoot bullet' button is left click, so, this game wants to be a shooter actually? go play fortnite instead\n\ntheres your blue meter you get from the chug jugs and it just makes you auto block when you get hit by attacks, but battles end up being just lame poke wars and kiting until you break the other guys armor and stunlock them to death, not fun\n\nconsumables take 10 years to use and its so easy to follow up on kills cause of dash speed and auto target abilities you either pick running for 10 minutes away from people, or risking drinking the potion- which doing so close to enemies just means you die, why? like every fight is so boring cause it plays out the same way, scuffle, if you're losing run for 10 years, get chased for 10 years\n\nwhen you die and get revived all your stats are reset, wow, amazing choice, feels awesome to experience (I am not telling the truth)\n\njust gonna dip my toes into the money making part... why do I get a character redeem ticket, but I actually can't redeem certain characters because they're gacha only. are you serious? what a joke\n\nI think if you're the type who enjoys 3D anime arena fighters like Naruto Storm or the Demon Slayer one wow, this game is perfect for you, but if you wanted to play a game where you've got tight movement and controls, combo expression, this is not worth

needs to rework its hero system and fast. You should not have to roll a loot box in order to get characters, or lock heroes in a battle pass! These should be cosmetic things only, such as costumes and etc, not actual heroes. Though, given how most of the costumes are just recolors ( including the ones in the battle pass, which is also just another bad call on there part. Make these items worth my money), I doubt they have the team behind them generate the cosmetics needed to get funding so they paywall the characters we know and love. \n\nThis game should base itself off of other hero based titles such as League of Legends, Overwatch, Dead by Daylight to name a few. All these games have lots of characters with unique abilities that will lure people in every patch to check out the new stuff. These characters can all be obtained with in-game currency or premium which people will shell out if they are just jumping in quick, but be rewarding to those long lasting players. \n\nThe heroes is the biggest negative to me, just be good to your player base and they'll be good to you. But the heroes, alongside the stale map and lack of game modes at the moment, this game needs a bit more time to figure itself out and focus on making a good game instead of a cash grab.", "timestamp_created": 1696033227, "timestamp_updated": 1696033227, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147317750": {"recommendationid": "147317750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198818674628", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 562, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1696106983}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome, yes it\u2019s hard but the more you practice the better u will get.

Its a mix of a fighting game and a battle royale, only it sucks at both.\nThe fighting aspect is horrendous, every combo being dropped after 1 ability or 3 regular hits. Opponents are immune for a brief period which renders you unable to do anything. It makes the combat feel very clunky as you often have to stop in the middle of combat and wait for the immune period to wear off. \nAs for the battle royale part, it is far from better. The map is extremely small, and a couple of characters are able to hit you from a pretty good distance making some of the cast much better than others (Bakugo). Also, the down mechanics are kinda clunky. Now this might be a bit of a skill issue, as I might have missed an item, but sometimes people get rezzed without anything or anyone being near them. For example, I was fighting a team and knocked down 1. The other 2 were on me and all of a sudden, the guy that was knocked out comes back to fight me. How he could come back still eludes me.\nLastly, the balancing of this game seems all over the place, as some characters feel wildly overpowered compared to others. While some have no movement abilities or range, Bakugo has one of the highest ranged attack with a very high amount of damage and 2 movement abilities, which makes fighting him extremely unfair.

I really ,really hope the game will be playable soon because honestly,the gameplay was really fun(even if it was very similar to fortnite) and I really liked almost every aspect of it.However,it is an online multiplayer game,so if I can't play an ONLINE MULTIPLAYER game with MY FRIENDS,then where is the fun in it?\nLoved the gameplay,but it needs proper bug fixes.I'll wait though.I am sure this game will turn out great,and when that time comes,I will give it a thumbs up,until then,I will,unfortunately give it a thumbs down.", "timestamp_created": 1696019597, "timestamp_updated": 1696019597, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458745032548904419", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147306433": {"recommendationid": "147306433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240202656", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 682, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1696058613}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Got something awesome!\"\n\n-Eijiro Kirishima", "timestamp_created": 1696019344, "timestamp_updated": 1696019344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147306407": {"recommendationid": "147306407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009787564", "num_games_owned": 436, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 123, "playtime_at_review": 123, "last_played": 1696019259}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is sooo sooo bad.

Crossplay should be standard for multiplatform competitive games these days, especially for something that's clearly taking a lot of inspiration from other battle royale games, most of which have crossplay.\n\nSecond, a lot of characters are locked, some behind gacha (With the option to unlock them for special credits that you get through duplicates), and some behind a VERY grindy battle pass (Albeit, a free one separate from the normal battle pass) that levels up super slowly and still has filler rewards between character unlocks.  You *do* get some free rental tickets that can be used to play any locked character for a single match, but if you're playing a lot that's obviously nothing.\n\nI think the game definitely has potential assuming they have regular content/balancing updates, but it needs crossplay ASAP if it wants to even survive and thrive for a full year, and locking playable characters should ideally be removed.  Or hell, at least just allow people to directly purchase individual characters (For a FAIR price, that is, not some outlandish price geared towards whales and obscured behind 50 different in-game currencies).", "timestamp_created": 1695986905, "timestamp_updated": 1695996250, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539295375347137451", "comment_count": 0,

I don't want to grind my ass off just to get the same costume but blue this time, you know what i mean?\n\nOne thing i dislike alot and people have already been talking about is the unlocking of characters. It's locked behind gacha which is a REALLY bad move from the devs. I don't get why they did this, imagine playing Fortnite but in order to use the new assault rifle or pistol you have to roll on a banner in which it has a 1% drop chance. If you're unlucky you're stuck using the same weapon you've used from whenever you've started playing the game but in this case it's possibly your favorite character from the anime which sucks even more if you don't get it. I personally think that if they don't change this system or atleast add some other way of getting the characters which is more user friendly (like for example getting a currency by playing the game and with that currency you can unlock the characters, LIKE EVERY SINGLE OTHER GAME ON THE MARKET), the game will die really fast and i really don't want that since i think the gameplay itself is fun.", "timestamp_created": 1695983341, "timestamp_updated": 1695983341, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147270248": {"recommendationid": "147270248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202101848", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1696085454}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun, slightly predatory microtransactions but it doesnt seem as bad as most say, characters arent in the battlepass, they're in the special pass, key difference is the special pass is NOT time limited and from what i can tell, and i will update when i know for sure, its also free, it just takes time to unlock some of the later characters like blood mommy and all might.\n\nGameplay is super fun, the pull system is weirdly hype however it is a lil stingy, i got lucky but some characters are locked behind the gacha and i assume that issue will get worse.\n\nAs far as base game goes you seem to get Deku, Uraraka, Mt lady, Cementoss, Shiggy and Dabi for free, worth mentioning since i know a lot of people will only play who they like", "timestamp_created": 1695983279, "timestamp_updated": 1695983279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147270246": {"recommendationid": "147270246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102300660", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 919, "playtime_at_review": 158, "last_played": 1696100352}, "language": "english", "review": "get to play as your favorite mha characters, fast load times and rapid queue times(maybe different depending on the time of day) \nServers seem very stable I've yet to see people complain about lag\n\nJust running around this map is quite satisfying.\nFights can go one of two ways, they'll either be a nice back and forth between your team and the enemy \nOr you just get blasted by characters with projectiles.\n1v3's are possible you just use hit and run tactics, not very possible when the last circles in the middle of no where though.\nProjectile characters feel very overpowering against characters without projectiles of their own as you can literally just hit and run.

The heroes and outfits work off a gatcha and loot box system, however as an Overwatch 2 player I'm used to worst abuse so I'd much rather the system in place than having to spend 19 dollars on a hero. I can see this game improving over time though, as many of my issues are with early release bugs and missing features that can be easily implemented.\n\nThe Good:\n- Fun gameplay\n- A unique spin on the BR genre\n- Matches are generally quick so if you lose, it doesn't feel as frustrating\n- Characters and abilities that are very on par with that of the show and source material.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Constant Unity crashes, I think I must have crashed 5 or 6 different times when I played.\n- SO many forms of currency\n- Terrible UI, the \"Leave game\" option is called \"Results\" at the end of a match and it can be very. very confusing to find things in the main menu.\n- No push to talk so most people turn off voice chat as it's constant open mic, really bad for a team based game\n- Ridiculous censoring in text chat when the source material uses worst. Really. The word/non-word \"uhoh\" you can't say. It makes it even more confusing when characters like Dabi will say \"Damn it\" when hurt or in a fight, yet you can't say it in the text chat.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game and it's free so it's worth a try at least. When you start the game it will load you down with in game currency and ticket pulls (the games version of loot boxes), however this is very common for gatcha games to get you in the door so I'm not really counting that as a plus for the game as much as I appreciate it. The downside is some of these characters are locked behind the gatcha system and the odds of getting them are around 0.5% each. Some people have brought up balancing issues, however once you learn each characters play style it's not as unbalanced as it's made out to be. Some characters excel in close range, others long range. I can see the developers intention of working with your teammates to pick up the weaknesses of each other however as stated previously, communication is almost impossible due to the bad voice chat system in the game so it makes this almost impossible to do with randoms.\n\nEdit: I do see a lot of people bringing up the monetization and at the end of the day, you need to pick your poison. One's Justice one and two both died very, very quickly as you had to pay for the game and anime based games aren't very popular in the first place so it makes sense why this game would be a free to play. Granted, I do wish there was a 60 dollar DLC option to just buy everything in the game, however the game still needs to make money somehow while still being available for a lot of people to play to keep it alive. This may be me speaking from a place of good luck but I haven't spent a penny on the game and so far I've been able to get Creati, Vine, the Shigaraki coat outfit AND upgrade to the premium pass all through just playing the game and getting the in game currency. From my perspective and keep in mind this is just me, you do not need to drop a bunch of money for stuff like you would need to in a game like Genshin Impact or Honkai.", "timestamp_created": 1695980821, "timestamp_updated": 1696106297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539295375347137451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147268510": {"recommendationid": "147268510", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087646078", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 783, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1696045744}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was an instant hit for me and my friends we played for 10 hours straight and I personally still get joy when i win because it feels like i actually earned it. there is not a better feeling than being gang raped by the entire server and walking out as the champion.

A pvp game were you must Gatcha for characters, with most not even unlock able and requiring a \"rental ticket\" to use for a single match (you can only hold three at a time and get three from the tutorial) This game has a pity system that makes Genshin look like a charity, for only 200 pulls you can get to CHOOSE THE CHARACTER YOU WANT. 200. To put that into perspective that would be 12,000 Hero Crystals (the in game premium currency) for 10 pulls, of which Hero Crystal Pack C for 13,000 of them is $25. The fact is even when your favorite character actually becomes available for you to own without gambling hundreds of dollars or renting every match, it will cost you 300 duplicate items from the Gatcha system to get ONE ticket to pick a character available. Currently the game has a roster of 18 characters, with only 6 available to start with, 3 for tickets, three for Gatcha, and fan favorites like Bakugo, Todoroki, Asui, and Toga as part of almost half the roster completely unavailable outside renting. BTW the Gatcha is 99% Cosmetics and will give you them for character that you literally can't own for anywhere for 2-? months from release. The quality of life is that of a Skid Row Encampment, they even have multiple lines of text for profile customization that are translated below the Japanese text before equipping yet are only available in Japanese The gameplay is as fun as it is basic, and yet the bots are incapable of even healing themselves as your teammates although they have 3 different tiers of bot only matches. This game is what happens when you have a company have an open casket funeral for a dead horse that was beaten at the morgue for 2 weeks straight, force everyone to take a bite of the rotten body, and then charge them $100 for each sip of water to wash it down after the soul binding contact to enter.

LADY...\n- Starting a battle... If I, the party leader, clicks start battle and we find a a second and or third teammate... It should not queue us all to click battle again... just give us the filled in teammate and put us in a lobby if no character swaps are necessary. \n\n- Characters locked behind Gacha Pay wall and Season pass.\n\n- The Free character item doesn't even have a name? Although you get 3 free uses a day\n\n- U.I is HORRIBLE... too many tabs to navigate Through. You get lost everytime.\n\n- Overwhelming amount of currencies. \n\n- Gacha is fine but you should be able to skip the initial animation and not the entire sequence.\n\n- initial character pool is BAD. It is easy to understand that they want the more crowd favorites to be a source of income via the gacha pay wall but... how did Cementos and Ibara make it into the game before Tokoyami, Mineta and Midnight...\n\n- In game combat becomes an EDM festival if a 3rd party occurs.\n\n- RANK SYSTEM NEEDS LOVE IN THE FIRST PATCH /  UPDATE. Ranks don't have a \"title\" its just an emblem with designs and colors. It doesn't tell you top rank, or have a list of how many stages each have or a \"more information\" button. you just click \"rank\" and it throws you in a game.\n\n- pregame lobby should have an area where you cant get blasted by other people while waiting to hop into a game because if you can't emote in the pregame area or the LOBBY who am I saucing for? You really are only able to flex emotes right before executing someone.\n\n- Map is KINDA SMALL.\n\n- You can view other peoples profile very easily by hovering over their name and clicking to view, but for yourself, you have to navigate through the menu button.\n\n- Go Crazy with the banner pictures... why are there barely any to select from on day 1? its literally screenshots from the anime. Give us like 200 to choose at least in the gacha system... \n\nIF THE FIRST QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATE IS NOT 77 PLUS ITEMS LONG THERE WILL BE AN ISSUE WITH THE GAMES SURVIVABILITY...\n \n\nPositives\n- MT. LADY\n- the game is BEAUTIFUL TO PLAY \"when doing a regular 3v3\" no third party...\n\n- The anime feel is so present you really do feel like a hero.\n\n- Every character plays completely different.\n\n- lots of items and beautiful map although tiny.\n\n- fast paced action\n\n- Character drip is drippy. Lots of costumes to make yourself stand out.\n\n- Nice variety of Roles.\n\n- doesn't take 20+ minutes a match \n\nThe most important fix would be when queuing to find a match you should select what role you wish to fill as (damage or support) so you can find your game without always making a character swap.\n\nI PRAY the developers listen to the community (Kinda how fortnite started out) and this game will thrive. They need to do an emergency Quality of life update because navigating the menu, the currencies and confusing text is absurd. The game is so much fun. I've enjoyed every minute so far in game.... (not a single minute enjoyed in the menus as we can't even boogie down with our emotes.) I WOULD recommend the game when it is in a better state but I would not recommend it currently because new people need to be introduced to this wonderful game with a more friendly interface. \n\nTime to hop back in a game.

It's like the developers took a masterclass in how to create a game that leaves you questioning your life choices.\n\nFirstly, the character design is so absurd that I thought I accidentally stumbled into a Saturday morning cartoon for toddlers. I mean, who thought it was a good idea to add Cementoss over literally anyone else.\nAnd let's talk about the controls. It's as if the game developers handed a toddler a baguette and said, \"Here you go, this is your controller now.\" Trying to execute a combo felt more like trying to tap dance on a minefield - random and explosive.\n\nThe in-game physics deserve an award for their commitment to chaos. I witnessed my hero soaring through the air like a majestic, slightly constipated eagle. The laws of gravity and common sense were mere suggestions in this digital disaster.\n\nOh, and let's not forget the sound effects. Every punch and kick sounds like a wet sponge hitting a brick wall. It's the kind of audio experience that makes you question whether you accidentally stepped on the cat or if it's just the game being its charming self.\n\nIn conclusion, My Hero Ultra Fumble is a masterpiece of incompetence. If you're looking for a game that will make you question your life choices and the state of the gaming industry, look no further. It's so bad that it's almost good \u2013 but not quite.

Even with that said I still have a good time playing this, even with randoms. It's of course not the best Battle Royale title, but it definitely has it's perks. I noticed a couple people complained about some of the hero's/villains being locked behind loot boxes which yes I can see that being an issue, but it gives the player reason to play a goal if you will outside of just winning. (You can get loot box's for free btw just need to play quite a bit) Outside of loot boxes you can slowly unlock quite a bit of characters for just playing. For example you unlock Bakugo once you reach lvl 2 in the season. Honestly though I would stop playing this game in like a week if I had every character given to me. I just think it's nice to main one hero/villain and then we you finally get a new hero it's a entire new experience . All in all I really like this game as of right now, and if the developers update this game right it will just get better from here. So for my final review I would give this game a 7/10 in the Battle Royale genre! \n\nAnd what the hell, the game is free what you reading this for just go check it out!", "timestamp_created": 1695964777, "timestamp_updated": 1696044590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147257923": {"recommendationid": "147257923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360339773", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 368, "playtime_at_review": 177, "last_played": 1696105749}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been handing out fades for about 3 hours in this game and I've gotta say, I have thoroughly enjoyed the time I've spent playing it.

Games go by fast and the characters are pretty fun however since they need to include gacha, a majority of the characters are locked behind it. I'm pretty iffy about this because in a PVP game with gacha and no way to unlock them straight up, outside of sparking for them, you can say that this game is pay to win. You do earn a small amount of the gacha tickets through dailies but that doesn't change the fact that you still need to gacha for the character that you want. I also wish they would use the gold that you earn to unlocking characters and not just useless gallery pieces and banners. If they really wanted to monetize this game properly they can just make costumes for the characters. This is a super hero game so it's very very easy to just give them whatever alternate costume and it'll more or less fit in universe, look at Marvel and how many versions of Spiderman there is.\n\nWe'll see how this will fare for the next few months, hopefully it doesn't become another Gundam Evolution where it just felt like a quick cash grab from Bamco.", "timestamp_created": 1695960795, "timestamp_updated": 1695960795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147255413": {"recommendationid": "147255413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972221173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 281, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1696054675}, "language": "english", "review": "anime spell break\n", "timestamp_created": 1695960686, "timestamp_updated": 1695960686, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147255384": {"recommendationid": "147255384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101313934", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 372, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1696025821}, "language": "english", "review": "Good PS2 Game 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1695960636, "timestamp_updated": 1695960636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147255370": {"recommendationid": "147255370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091085498", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "playtime_at_review": 102, "last_played": 1695960527}, "language": "english", "review": "Himiko Toga is the reason i wanted this game, shes locked behind a gacha wall. \ngameplay is mid\ni need more Toga\nGive me Toga", "timestamp_created": 1695960614, "timestamp_updated": 1695960614, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147255362": {"recommendationid": "147255362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263581851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 329, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1696066158}, "language": "english", "review": "I play this game with my best friend Nguyen Hoang Long and he said he would play Todoroki and I have to call him Icy-Hot through comms.

Sure. Is it a good Battle Royale Game? No. \n\nFor what this game tries to be, it fails in so many ways. Combat just feels clunky, voice acting doesn't immerse me, it puts me OUT of the game. The like 20 different currencies lost me and just made me feel like I was playing a mobile game which isn't a good look. Speaking of, this game LOOKS like one. It somehow looks worse than MHA: The strongest hero which IS a mobile game. I couldn't even play as my personal favorite character Shoto because hes locked behind a GACHA WHEEL. This game had so much potential, and it leaves it on the ground, opting to just try and shake you of money through constant micro-transactions. If you want a better My Hero Academia fighting game, My Hero One's Justice 2 is right there. it ain't free, but at least it's GOOD and won't beg on its hands and knees for you to buy something off of it. \n\nFor what it is, It's fun and its a good time waster. Even if half the time you don't know what the hell your doing, I can't say i didn't enjoy my time with this game. The combat is decent and it's a good time with friends, Y'now as long as your not trying cross-play which ISN'T AVAILABLE. I'm only recommending this game because as a My Hero fan, I found it fun in a goofy, unserious way. If you turn your brain off and just tell yourself your playing a dumb My hero game for shits and giggles, it's all there. Just don't stare too hard at it, because it's cracks won't be afraid to show. Come for the combat and dumb fun of kicking each others asses, leave when the game asks you for a 4.99 one-time purchase.\n\nSolid 5/10.

So take that into consideration as well.\n\nThe game itself is... alright. It's a battle royale, but with fun superpowers. The controls are a little jank, but I'm sure with time you could adjust to them because they're not unplayably bad. It's super fast paced, which can make it a little difficult to try and pay attention to what's happening, and where you're being attacked from. Most of my experience is from Apex, which when I last played was pretty similar to this. Less intensive on the computer though, so there's that plus.\n\nThe main, glaring issue, is the gacha system. It blows absolute chunks. It has a horrible pity system, where with 200 rolls you can guarantee yourself one of the 3 characters in the current loot rolls. I didn't do the exact math, but from eyeballing it would definitely be more than $100 for one character if you got extremely unlucky. Which, given that the loot tables show that each item that you can pull has a less than 1% chance to even be pulled, you probably won't get the character you want.\nAnd to unlock characters, from what me and my friend could figure out (which took way too long, the currencies and how to unlock stuff isn't explained well at all) you need hero tickets, which you can get for 100 souls. Only once, mind you. Then you can get one ticket for 200 souls. Then from that point on all tickets will be 300 souls. What are souls? Duplicates from pulls on the gacha. You /might/ be able to get a handful from missions or the battle pass, but I wouldn't count on it.\nBut as you read yes- on top of a gacha with a horrible pity system, there is a battle pass. The free one, I will say is quite generous compared to most free tracks, but you don't get a lot of exp per game to level it. So to get the characters locked behind that as well, expect to grind a hell of a lot.\n\nNow, gachas are pretty normal in F2P games in the past few years, and I understand some people don't mind them as much. If it was solely cosmetic, I really wouldn't mind them, but they do end up being pretty predatory no matter what. It's especially worse when whole characters, in a PVP game, are locked behind luck based pulls. And not all of the characters are created equal, either. It's almost similar to the Overwatch 2 situation, where there is competitive modes locked behind gacha and pass mechanics. Hell, even a game like Pokemon Unite pulls it off better than this game does.\n\nThere isn't even an option to purchase them out right with real money, which is really a shame. I totally would've put a few bucks in to be able to play as my fave character, Kirishima, but he's locked behind the gacha for this time around. Probably would've come back to it from time to time, because the quirks do make combat interesting, but you're given 1 free hero ticket at the time of this review, and 3 sort of \"trial\" tickets, where you can try out 3 different heroes, or the same hero 3 times.\n\nIf you really like My Hero, and have the money to blow for the stuff you want, then sure go for it. But if there's just one or two characters you wanna play, I'm sure the fighting game they made would probably be better suited. \n\ntl;dr:\nmid game, insane amounts of gacha and battle pass microtransactions, has potential to be fun but characters that are better than others being locked behind paywalls is a horrible way to do shit and sours most of the experience\ni had no expectations and yet it somehow failed to meet them", "timestamp_created": 1695954305, "timestamp_updated": 1695954377, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147251081": {"recommendationid": "147251081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983674874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1695954249}, "language": "english", "review": "game bad ooooo", "timestamp_created": 1695954288, "timestamp_updated": 1695954288, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147251060": {"recommendationid": "147251060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075273025", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1695953328}, "language": "english", "review": "At the time of this review I've played for 1h30 and I can already see where this game needs to improve.\n\nThe negative:\n\n- You can't unlock characters directly, you only get 3 free game per day with locked characters, if you want to unlock them permanently, you have to spend points you get when using a roll which is basically a loot-box.\nI've used about 20 rolls and I managed to get 48 points, a character costs 200 points.\nMy guess is that the free characters are going to change each day or week but it's frustrating.\n\n- The fighting mechanic is very confusing, we know the anime is full of special effects every time a character attacks which they recreated here. I get that they wanted to keep the fighting style of the source material which is fine when 2 or 3 people are fighting but when you get 10 heroes or villains fighting at the same place it gets really chaotic.\n\n- There's only one map and it is very tiny\n\n- The items you get for free or those in the shop have no description, I bought a character ticket thinking I'd be able to unlock a hero but it doesn't seem to work that way and I still haven't figured out what it does lol\n\n- Leveling up your hero agency (which is basically a guild) takes ages, I did about 10 games and the progress bar barely moved\n\nThe positive:\n\n- The aesthetic of the anime is there, same for the sound effects.\n\n- The character models are really well made and have fun costumes. Not a lot as per now but I'm sure they'll add more in the future\n\n- Speaking about costumes, you can easily unlock a lot of them. Yes, it is a loot-box system but even if you get doubles, you get currency you can spend in the shop. Also, there's a special type of costume which has different colors of auras.\nEvery time you get doubles of one of those, you get access to a new aura color that you can use to customize this said outfit.\n\n- The gameplay is simple yet varied enough to turn the tied of the battle to your advantage when the right strategy is used. That is IF you manage to understand what is happening on screen.\n\n\nOverall, the game is not bad, I wouldn't recommend it in its actual state, unless you're a big fan of the anime and you're not epileptic.\n\n\n\nEdit:\nThanks guys for explaining some things that were not clear to me.\nMuch appreciate it :)\n\nI'll give it another go and see if I enjoy it more.", "timestamp_created": 1695954255, "timestamp_updated": 1696103058, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 232, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744163095951080322", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147250995": {"recommendationid": "147250995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043005376", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 381, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1696104300}, "language": "english", "review": "MHA + Fortnite + Moba", "timestamp_created": 1695954161, "timestamp_updated": 1695954161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147250953": {"recommendationid": "147250953", "author": {"steamid": "76561199144525784", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 349, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1696036346}, "language": "english", "review": "Just putting this here for all of those pesky Negative reviews, most of them just launched the game after all!\n\nI can see why there is Negative reviews for locked characters (Even I think its stupid how some unlocks work.)\nTo sum how separate unlocks work:\n[list]\n[*] Some characters are locked behind a \"special\" Battle pass that takes WAY too long to grind to permanently unlock characters\n[*] The three new Heroes to the game are in the gacha, so I hope in next rolls you can at least use licenses to unlock.\n[*] (Did I forget to mention that apparently those hero licenses you use reset every season...?

I've been waiting to replay the game since the beta and its been a blast to play, even solo! Leveling up is simple, and combat is decent, the only nitpicks I have is when an entire team is down, you can all still self res (And most of the time, one of you WILL get up if they loose track of all of you in a fight as some characters take way too long to finish downed players.), Downing players don't count as your KO still, the person that executes them gets the kill...?, And some characters are still just as busted as ever. For example, Mt. Lady's enlarge is still way too tanky for its own good, making 1v1 fights and 1v2 fights downright unfair in final zones with nothing you can really do but to hope you can find cover somewhere.\n\nOther than that, its a fun free to play battle royale game, you just gotta deal with having to grind for way too long to unlock specific characters and a DREADED GACHA.

I wouldn't wish this game upon my worst enemy, and I feel genuinely sorry for anyone who spent their hard-earned money on it.\n\nLet's start with the graphics. In a world where breathtaking visuals are becoming the norm, MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE looks like it was designed by a team of amateurs with a limited budget. Character models are bland, environments lack detail, and the animations are so stiff and lifeless that it's hard to believe this game was released in the 21st century.\n\nThe gameplay is a mess. Combat feels clunky and unresponsive, with poorly designed controls that make you want to throw your controller across the room in frustration. The hit detection is laughable, and the AI is so brain-dead that you'll wonder if you're playing against a bunch of cardboard cutouts. The game's mechanics are convoluted and poorly explained, leaving you to figure things out through trial and error.\n\nThe story is an afterthought, with a plot so generic and uninspired that it's forgettable within minutes. The voice acting is equally forgettable, with characters delivering their lines in a monotonous, emotionless fashion that drains any potential for immersion.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest insult is the microtransactions. MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE shamelessly bombards you with in-game purchases at every turn. Want a new character? Pay up. Want a cool costume? Pay up. It's a blatant cash grab that preys on unsuspecting players.\n\nSave your money and your sanity. Avoid MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE at all costs. It's a disgrace to the gaming industry, and I can't believe I wasted my time on this dumpster fire of a game.", "timestamp_created": 1695951885, "timestamp_updated": 1695951885, "voted_up": false,
