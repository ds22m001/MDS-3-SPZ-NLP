Very different and refreshing from all the other standard modern games. The attention to detail is very good.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to grasp, making it accessible for younger players while still offering a challenge for the more experienced gamers. It's the perfect balance of fun and a little bit of strategy as you progress further in the game. \n\nOne of the standout features of the game is that's very family-friendly oriented. It's refreshing these days to find a game that doesn't rely on violence or inappropriate themes. It's just very simple, you log in and get straight into the fun shamelessly eating everything that's on your way + bonus points when you can play with your friends or kids where you need to work together. It's really fantastic to see my family members shouting: ''Nooo, help me the dog is chasing me'' or ''Throw the bomb, throw the bomb!!!''. Very joyful and funny with lots of laughs. \n\nI got to say music is veeeery catchy and sound effects of animals and all other aspects are adorable which brings overall charm of the game. \n\nI don't leave reviews very often but for this I gladly took my time to write one. It's a wholesome, family-oriented experience that promotes bonding and laughter. It's a game that grandparents can enjoy with their grandkids, siblings can play together, and parents can have a blast with their children. As said, it's a rare gem that brings everyone closer in a world filled with violent and complex video games and this is a shining example of entertainment that we need to see more. \n\nIt will leave smile on your face and a craving for pizza in your heart and belly. So, gather your family, order some pizza, and dive into the delightful world of Pizza Possum.

The king, King Doggy Boy if you will, is whipping up a mighty fine and big pizza; this, be as it may, is the very thing you want in life, King Doggy Boy's pizza.\n\nYou get a couple of power ups and try to sneakily (or very blatantly, whichever is your style) go around the town eating the peoples food to obtain keys, which unlock the doors to higher elevations on Mt. Doggy; in which, at the very top, is the pizza of your dreams.\n\nOnce you completely obliterate King Doggy Boy's pizza, you get the Kings crown and need to do that 2 more times back-to-back without getting caught to complete the main game.\n\nTherefore: its a solid 9.5/10 an amazing little game that doesn't overdue its stay, a masterpiece of the small-time games. I love it\n\nTHE ONLY CONS THAT I HAVE:\n1.) I wish it was longer and had a variety of pizza-related things\n2.) That instead of losing all the crowns when getting caught, make it so that you only lose one.

Thanks to Pizza Possum, I had the chance to experience this, and I'm glad I did. The game is presented to us in an arcade style and puts us in the role of a sneaky possum with a very clear purpose: to fill its belly. Between hiding and running away from the guards, colorful and cartoon-ish visuals, and simple controls that offer excellent accessibility, this is a game that aims for the most basic and essential aspect of a game: fun; and in my opinion, it works well.\n\nPizza Possum leaves aside complexity and complicated settings and focuses on getting us right into the action with only a brief introduction to the game. Basically, we\u2019ll be a sneaky and extremely hungry possum, who seeks to satisfy its stomach no matter what, and what better target than a freshly baked pizza? I feel identified. Even so, she will leave no plate or basket untouched on her way.\n\nTo reach our goal, we\u2019ll have to eat what we find around us while exploring enclosed areas. As we eat we generate points for our high-score, filling a bar that once complete will grant us a key to continue advancing; sometimes you can choose between different paths, but they are very specific rooms. By the way, I should add that you have to be careful with eating too much and too fast, because it can cause our character to get fat and lose speed... almost like in real life, huh?\n\nBut if that were all, the game would be a bit simple and not so interesting, so the game also has other obstacles that will stand in our way, in the form of guard dogs. These guards will be on the lookout, patrolling or guarding specific points in the areas, and will chase us as soon as we catch their attention. There are several types of watchdogs, some with their own abilities such as calling for reinforcements, and if they manage to capture us they will send us back to the start or to a checkpoint, if we have passed through one.\n\nThere are several ways in which we can avoid being captured, being the first and easiest: dodging. The controls are extremely simple, we move with the directional pad and we have an interaction button, so with a little skill we can evade our pursuers; although perhaps it is easier said than done, so if we find ourselves in a somewhat more problematic situation we can hide in the bushes and wait for the danger to pass, as long as we don\u2019t hide right in front of them!\n\nSometimes it can be very difficult to just run and hide, but for moments like this we'll also have objects that are unlocked as our score increases, and will be of great help to avoid being caught. These items are obtained progressively, and we'll have energy drinks to run faster, traffic fences that the guards can not cross (they are very honest and polite), or even a canine guardian disguise to eat around them without being noticed.\n\nThese objects are found in special boxes, and while there are various types, we are allowed to carry only one at a time, except for passive bonuses such as a mask that make us more difficult to discern. Fortunately, when we replace one of these bonuses the other remains on the floor and can be picked up at any time. One thing I did a lot was to take the energy drink, drink it, and replace it with something else, thus having the speed boost and another item to use at any time. Big brain time!\n\nThe only thing I didn't like as much was that when you get the score needed for an upgrade, the score resets; in that case, accumulating a lot of points plays against us in that aspect, because the leftover ones are wasted, and there is no way (or I didn't find it) to know if we have enough score for an upgrade or not without having to get caught. On top of that, sometimes invisible guards would appear, which you can imagine creates very uncomfortable situations! (This is clearly a bug, though).\n\nAs we progress, the security grows more active and the areas get more difficult, and it becomes quite challenging as we get closer to the goal. Once we deal with the security and are able to scarf down the freshly baked pizza, we'll acquire a crown and a new mission: to be crowned three times. Here, in my opinion, the difficulty increases significantly, not only because of the number of tenacious guards that appear on the map, but because getting caught means losing the crowns we carry with us. I must say that this was especially challenging for me.\n\nAmong all that, I had moments that were very frantic and hilarious, like being chased by half a pack of guard dogs while the character was trying its best to escape with a chubby body. These types of situations were what entertained me the most in the game, making me say phrases like \"Run, little one, run!\" in the excitement of the moment. And it becomes even more fun in multiplayer, which is one of the other main features of the game, and which I was able to try out a little by taking my nephew hostage. It's worth noting that it's local multiplayer, for the time being.\n\nThe biggest difference with multiplayer is that when one of the two players is caught, the other player can approach to help them (without having to press anything, just get close enough to the captor), and that the screen splits in two when we are separated from our partner. I must say that we tried to stay as close as possible, because the split camera adds another layer of extra difficulty, for the simple reason that it reduces our range of vision and many times the guards will see you before they even come on screen. A bit complex, but it is what it is, and probably can be mitigated on higher resolutions.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that Pizza Possum is a game that puts gameplay and fun front and center, in pursuit of making our experience as players enjoyable and entertaining. It has cute and cartoonish visuals, and a soundtrack that combines well with the theme, and both sections make a ribbon that finishes wrapping up the game. Some details that I found cute were for example a sound that indicates when an object is cooling down, or the funny little voices of the characters when they patrol, chase us and so on.\n\nAs I mentioned before, it's a title I might have passed on another time, but I'm glad I tried it. It's perfect for a fun time, it lends itself to replayability for those who like to improve and beat their high-scores, and I think it's also ideal for those looking to have a few laughs in multiplayer.\n", "timestamp_created": 1695923225, "timestamp_updated": 1695923225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586071252822875977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 87, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 103, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 103}, "cursors": {"AoJ4mti57ooDdqXPsQQ=": "Sun Oct  1 11:59:04 2023"}}
