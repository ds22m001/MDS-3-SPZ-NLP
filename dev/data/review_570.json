The sheer variety of heroes with their unique abilities and playstyles ensures that no two matches are ever the same, constantly challenging you to adapt and think on your feet. The meticulous balance and constant updates from the developers showcase their commitment to delivering a fair and competitive experience. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer, Dota 2 offers an immersive and rewarding gameplay experience (similar to that of league of legends) that will keep you hooked for countless hours while fostering a vibrant community of players who share the same passion for this iconic MOBA.

Nothing says \"fun\" like being told you're a noob by someone who's been playing since the original Dota mod was a thing.\n\nBut hey, if you enjoy the sweet, sweet taste of victory after enduring hours of pain, frustration, and internal screaming, Dota 2 might just be your new favorite form of self-torture.

The game is absolutely not easy, more than 100 heroes, more than 100 items, neutral items, which you have to figure out. In other games, you can finish your progress in 100 hours, but in dota, you can only start your journey in 100 games, because rating games open when you have 100 hours on your account. Each game takes an average of 30-40 minutes and there are 10 heroes in each game, which makes each game absolutely unique. After calibration, at best you will get to the guardian, but it is considered that this is one of the lowest ratings in dota. For 1000 hours in dota, you may not even get out of this rating if you don't improve every time. I played 1500 hours in dota and this huge number of hours gave me a lot of both positive and negative emotions.\\\n\nThanks to the game, I have found friends who will tolerate me even if I am aggressive or poking at every mistake. \nThank you for teaching me strategic thinking and microcontrol and the skill of fast typing in both Russian and English. \nThank you for distracting me during difficult periods in my life and for allowing me to distract myself from the problems that surrounded me at that time.\n\nBut not everything is so good, because the game took me a ton of time, because 1500 hours is the time for which you could do a lot: find friends in IRL, find a girl, finally learn English and take time for exams that are important to me. The fact that I play dota was the reason for a joke for my classmates that I'm not like that and so on. Aggression towards me only makes me stronger, but let's not talk about crying, because this is an analysis of my path, not a sad story. But by the exams I overcame myself and decided to devote myself to studying and passed satisfactorily. The main disadvantage of dota is that it forced me to be a little bit toxic and aggressive. Because the community of the game is like that and there is nothing you can do about it. I've changed character, maybe it's for the better, maybe for the worse who knows.\n\nAnd this review was written primarily for myself, so that I would never download this game again, because I have already set priorities and dota is definitely not in first or even second place. And about the experience that I went through, I would just like to share with people what this game is, because it is so addictive that at the moment I had 180 hours in the last 2 weeks. Those who know how to control themselves and have good self-discipline, this game is relevant, but those who have goals and ambitions, this game is not the same. People spend the best years of their lives in it, I've never met people with 10 thousand games, 15 thousand and even 20, I don't want to be like that, so I deleted it. Thank you all if you read it, it's about experience, about life and about the game that changed me and my perception\n", "timestamp_created": 1694188980, "timestamp_updated": 1694188980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145916964": {"recommendationid": "145916964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017562724", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 287556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 906, "playtime_at_review": 285729, "last_played": 1696119842}, "language": "english", "review": "If I did not play dota for 4762 hours and put those hours into a business I would be a millionaire I tell you.

"review": "I have played this game for around 120h now. It is an amazing game, the characters look awesome and the abilities are far beyond the competition. But the gameplay itself sucks.\n\nI experienced dozens of greefers.\nPlayers walking up to the lane, dieing and repeating this until the enemy team is super fed and whipes the other team. Players that I would not trust to breath. This is not cool, when a low life enemy walks up to me, I dont feel good because i can lagoon blade him from 10% to 0.\n\nI had players in my team that where obviesly not in the same skill level as I.\nLast game, i had a player that started yesterday and played that part.\nI had players that singlehandedly won the match.\n\nWins feel unsatisfying and looses are bullshit.\n\nWhy implement a social credit system if it dosnt even work?\nI tried to stay positive, comment good players and report bad behavior. It does not matter.\nI still get the same bunch of players. \nNow i find myself grinding turbo just to get above 10k so I can get coached and learn this overcomplicated mess of a game.\n\nThe devs might say that I should play ranked than. I CANT, because of the 100h limit to ranked.\n\nThe games balancing is beginner unfriendly.\nRather than picking a hero that you like to play, you have to pick what hurts enemies the most. In low elo this should not matter. When you want to play an rts, the game would be foolish to ask you to play chess instead.\n\nI criticise in league of legends that some heroes are just not fun to play against. Most people in dota are made to be that way. They are made to ruin your day more than you can ruin theirs.\nA recipee for a healthy playerbase.\n\nSome heroes are knowlage checks in league, annoying to play against if you dont know how to. Dota is nearly 100% knowlage checks. You dont know what that one asssassin the enemy team has is specialized in? DO or die.\n\nNow to items.\nThe general rule i learned is the following. The first three items are to make you stronger, the last three are to make the enemy weaker.\n\nWhat items you buy does not only depend on what you are playing, but what the other team is playing. At this point coaching becomes mendetory.

"review": "After playing quite a lot of multiplayer games, I have come to a conclusion, that dota 2 is the worst one out of all. I feel like 99% players of dota 2 community have either played it for some time (there are literally 0 newbies) or untermenschen with newly made account, who only play against players that are new to the game. Each game that I have tried before is somehow acceptable or playable for the new players, ranking system is also somewhat good, but dota 2 is the complete opposite of the both points I listed above. If you wanna give this game a try in 2023 (and you obviously have never played it before) then dont, the whole community is pretty much made of players who already played the game for some time, or players with newly made accounts (you will most likely get queued against these, just like me).

i found other games that are actually fun. But my friends were all on this game lately so I come back like 9 years after quitting and its even worse but not just that, this game has a way of making you addicted to being angry at random smug bastards online for hours on end. Im sure if you dedicate the time and effort to play this garbage and also for the therapy that you need after playing it, theres a interesting complex web of characters who all interact with one another in some cool ways.But all that comes once you learn the game or whatever but i swear its impossible to understand the game and what's going on without devoting about 5 years of your life to pizzaface-ing this game until you're understand, but thats only like half of it. Wanting to play the game and learn to get better in current year sucks so bad because every match some asshole, either on your team or the other, will berate you for the duration of the match for your pick, where you go, not killing people, not knowing how to play the game, whole time they have 3000 WORTHLESS hours on the game, so OBVIOUSLY THEY WILL KNOW BETTER, and be as annoying as possible about it. The people who play the game make it unbearable to even try getting better, matches are either it's a smooth win where you barely feel anything, or the WORST 45-70 minutes of your entire life, making you wish the worst on people. The moments i have enjoyed playing this game i think i could count on one hand, and 3 of those are like the times where I actually am able to do something because I didn't get matched with people who have half their lifespan on the game, so i get to build my stuff and play the game for once. Overall its mostly just the community is so bad there's very few people who aren't obnoxious about the game and discourage you from even finishing the game Lmao Literal waste of time DO NOT INSTALL if you haven't been hooked on it.

Developed by Valve, this multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) is a timeless classic that has captured the hearts of gamers worldwide. So, grab your courier and dust off your keyboard, because we're diving into the world of Dota 2 \u2013 where strategy, teamwork, and a good sense of humor can be the key to victory.\n\nGameplay and Complexity:\nDota 2 is a game that's as intricate as a Rubik's cube, and just like the cube, it can be a perplexing puzzle at first glance. The game is built on a foundation of complex mechanics, with a vast array of heroes, items, and strategies waiting to be explored.\n\nEach hero is unique, like a snowflake in a blizzard, with its own set of abilities and playstyle. Learning the ins and outs of each hero can be as daunting as deciphering an ancient scroll, but fear not \u2013 practice, guides, and the occasional trial and error will lead to mastery.\n\nThe depth of gameplay is like an ocean, with waves of tactics and strategies crashing against each other. From split-pushing to smoke ganking, the possibilities are as endless as a treant's branches. So dive in, but beware \u2013 you might get swept away like a ship caught in a tempest.\n\nTeamwork and Communication:\nAs much as Dota 2 is a game about individual skill, it's even more about teamwork and coordination. Like a well-tuned orchestra, a cohesive team can orchestrate breathtaking plays that leave opponents stunned.\n\nHowever, much like herding cats or convincing a Riki to buy wards, coordinating with teammates can be a challenge. Communication is the key to success, and having a positive attitude is as vital as a healing salve in a team fight.\n\nIn the heat of battle, things can get as chaotic as a pugna's ward in the middle of a skirmish. But remember, laughter and friendly banter can be the glue that holds your team together, even in the face of adversity.\n\nThe Learning Curve:\nOh, the learning curve of Dota 2 \u2013 it's as steep as a mountaintop and as treacherous as a dark jungle at night. But don't fret; it's all part of the journey to becoming a seasoned Dota player.\n\nThe game won't hold your hand like a caring support hero, and mistakes will be made like a Storm Spirit zipping into danger. But each blunder is an opportunity to learn and grow, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.\n\nExpect to encounter a mix of emotions, from the exhilaration of landing that perfect black hole to the frustration of getting caught in a chain of crowd controls. But like a phoenix, you'll rise stronger and wiser, ready to take on the next challenge.\n\nEsports and Competitive Scene:\nDota 2 is not just a game; it's an esports phenomenon that rivals the intensity of a championship boxing match. The competitive scene is as vibrant as a rainbow colored Arcana, with tournaments that attract massive audiences and offer life-changing prizes.\n\nWatching the pros play is like attending a masterclass in Dota strategy and execution. But don't be too hard on yourself if you can't replicate their plays \u2013 even the best chess players would struggle to mimic a grandmaster's moves.\n\nUpdates and Community Involvement:\nOne thing you can always count on in Dota 2 is a steady stream of updates and patches, like a river flowing through the battlefield. Valve actively listens to the community's feedback and tweaks the game to keep it fresh and balanced.\n\nAnd speaking of the community, it's a melting pot of personalities and nationalities, like a United Nations of Dota players. Embrace the diversity, but be prepared to encounter a few goblins in the tavern \u2013 trolls can be as common as creeps on the map.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Dota 2 is a game that's as challenging as it is rewarding, as frustrating as it is exhilarating, and as deep as a lore book in the game's universe. Its complexity and teamwork requirements make it a unique and captivating experience that can keep you hooked like an addictive elixir.\n\nSo, if you're ready to dive into the strategic world of Dota 2 and embark on a journey of learning, growth, and epic battles, grab your mouse and keyboard and join the fray. Just remember, in the realm of Dota 2, humor and camaraderie are as valuable as a well-executed strategy.\n\nWelcome to the battlefield, where heroes rise, towers fall, and the Ancient awaits its fate.

However, my personal experience with DOTA 2 has left me disappointed and frustrated. In this review, I will delve into the aspects that have contributed to my negative perception of the game.\n\nGameplay Complexity:\nOne of the most significant issues I encountered while playing DOTA 2 is the overwhelming complexity of its gameplay mechanics. The learning curve is exceedingly steep, making it extremely challenging for newcomers to grasp the intricacies of the game. The sheer number of heroes, their unique abilities, and the intricate strategies required to succeed make it an unwelcoming experience for casual players. The lack of a comprehensive tutorial or beginner-friendly modes only exacerbates this issue, leaving players feeling lost and discouraged.\n\nToxic Community:\nAnother prominent drawback of DOTA 2 is its toxic community. The game seems to attract a disproportionately high number of toxic players, who revel in berating and harassing others. The incessant verbal abuse, derogatory language, and unsportsmanlike behavior create an unwelcoming and hostile environment. It becomes disheartening when one's focus should be on enjoying the game but instead becomes a battle against the toxicity emanating from fellow players.\n\nUnbalanced Matchmaking:\nDOTA 2's matchmaking system has proven to be a constant source of frustration. Far too often, matches are marred by severe imbalances in player skill levels. It's disheartening to be pitted against experienced players as a novice, leading to an unfair and demoralizing gameplay experience. The lack of a proper skill-based matchmaking algorithm tarnishes the competitive integrity of the game, making it feel like an uphill battle with insurmountable odds.\n\nStagnant Updates:\nDespite its immense popularity, DOTA 2 suffers from a lack of timely and meaningful updates. The game's development seems stagnant, with long stretches of time passing between significant content additions. This lack of fresh content and innovation leaves players feeling bored and disengaged. Without regular updates, DOTA 2 fails to keep up with evolving trends in the gaming industry and fails to provide a captivating experience for its player base.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile DOTA 2 has amassed a dedicated fanbase over the years, my personal experience with the game has been disappointing. The overwhelming complexity, toxic community, unbalanced matchmaking, and stagnant updates have all contributed to a negative perception of the game. For those seeking an enjoyable and welcoming gaming experience, DOTA 2 may not be the ideal choice.", "timestamp_created": 1688741798, "timestamp_updated": 1688741798, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612090826034545898", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144629818": {"recommendationid": "144629818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117722058", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 576952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1797, "playtime_at_review": 571706, "last_played": 1695997291}, "language": "english", "review": "compendiums  i liked, like turbo mode, feel hero selection should be so that you have to select a carry and a support as well as a tank and two selections for the team must be random, dislike swearing and abuse of players and in the same breath enjoy the good attitude of some players which should be rewarded. they make you want to play win or lose.", "timestamp_created": 1692524333, "timestamp_updated": 1692524333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603696703910827637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142439093": {"recommendationid": "142439093", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984067933", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 426488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1811, "playtime_at_review": 418999, "last_played": 1695990634}, "language": "english", "review": "Please make terrible manners or offensive language a reportable offense.

Dota+ gives only strategical advice, but it is still an advantage to players, who's skill level doesn't allow to perform the same strategical steps on their own (or simply reminds them of things, partially eliminating their human error factor, which is also part of what is considered a player skill). Moreover, it is based on gathered match statistics data across the entire player base, which makes it more impactful that just a default hero item guide, which is available for everybody.\n[/list]\n\n[*] [b]Learning curve[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] This game requires hundreds of hours, just to be comprehended to an adequate degree, and thousands of hours to truly master, let alone all the time required to read the ability/character/item/world/mechanics specifics in the game and on wiki.\n[/list]\n\n[*] [b]Cheaters[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] There is 3rd party software, which allows players to cheat in this game, this includes: auto-casting (without player input), map vision through fog of war, scripting, etc.\n[/list]\n\n[*] [b]Bugs[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] Nearly every significant update either breaks the game or introduces bugs, that are not getting fixed for months or even years. Sometimes bugs are so critical, they don't allow players to win in a fair match due to the game becoming simply unfair (such types of bugs include: killing an enemy upon re-spawn of the latter (without it being possible under normal conditions); permanent character immunity to damage; permanent character untargetability; etc.), but such critical bugs are usually fixed way quicker, that for example UI bugs, that persist for way longer.\n[/list]\n\n[*] [b]Balance[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] Even though skill is more relevant that the meta, the game has a history of having problems with balancing. For instance some characters may be way more unfairly constrained in terms of defense/DPS/mobility than the others, clearly defining meta and making game experience horrible on nerfed characters. I'm not implying, that there should be no downsides of playing every hero, rather that at all times and for every hero there should be upsides present, that are able to balance the character disadvantages, and make the playing experience enjoyable.\n[/list]\n\n[*] [b]Community[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] Majority of the player base is so entitled and toxic, that ingesting cyanide seems like a healthier option at times. This applies to all skill ranks in game, both explicit and implicit.\n[/list]\n\n[*] [b]Ranking[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] The game has explicit and implicit ranking systems (this entire point is a personal assumption and something I've heard way too many times from other players). Explicit rank is available for everybody to see after playing enough ranked games, while implicit rank is internally evaluated by the the game, and is way more precise to define how skilled a player is. I have no problem with the explicit rank, because it is at least fixed now after many years, and is rather fair, because a player gets matched with the teammates and opponents of approximately same rank and skill level (not accounting for smurfs and bought account players). The main problem arises when playing non-competitive matches, where the skill level of players in a particular team is balanced out based on their IMPLICIT rank, and if a player has played the game for thousands of hours, and is somewhat \"good\" at this game, they will get a teammate, who has been playing for only a month and has a skill of a person who played as much (not a smurf). This happens in order to balance out the average skill level in the team, when the implicit ranking system can't find the teammate/opponent match of the same level, the problem is that the skill difference may be so large in a team A, that the opposing team B, who will have players with individual skill levels very similar to each other, will win, just because the team A has a person, who is not skilled enough to deliver enough impact, and that skilled teammate in team A, who got balanced out with a less skilled teammate can't always bring impact of 2 players to the table, which makes the entire non-competitive ranking system unfair. This example is considering that there is only 1-to-1 balancing trade, but the situation may get even worse, when there are 2 way higher skilled players, and 3 way less skilled in the same team.\n[/list]\n\n[*] [b]Ambiguity[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] There are unlisted ability mechanics and ability/item combination details, that may not even be listed on the wiki. Many things can only be tested/discovered on the fly, which may unexpectedly affect the match outcome. There is a possibility to test things in a local session sandbox, which is easily accessible, yet there\nare still aspects of the game, that just are either very complicated to test beforehand, or outright impossible even in the sandbox.\n[/list]\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1689249469, "timestamp_updated": 1690969868, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0,

Picture this: a battlefield filled with colorful heroes, epic battles, and enough salt to preserve the entire Dead Sea. It's like playing chess, if chess had an army of foul-mouthed wizards and a couple of dragons thrown in for good measure.\n\nIf you're a fan of complex strategy games and enjoy the sweet taste of victory mixed with the bitter tears of defeat, Dota 2 is your poison. The learning curve? Oh, it's as steep as Mount Everest, but hey, who needs socializing and sunlight when you can spend hours figuring out why that damn courier isn't delivering your items? And let's not forget the joy of playing with random strangers who magically transform into keyboard warriors, ready to hurl insults at the slightest mistake.\n\nBut don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a masterpiece in its own right. The depth of gameplay is unparalleled, with an ever-expanding roster of heroes and an intricate meta that changes more often than my socks (which isn't saying much, by the way). The satisfaction of executing a perfectly timed combo or orchestrating a teamfight victory is enough to make you forget the countless times you've been called a \"noob\" by a prepubescent teenager.\n\nValve, the creators of Dota 2, deserve credit for creating a game that inspires both love and hatred in equal measure. The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is addictive, and the competitive scene is as intense as a tiger's glare. And let's not forget about the TI, the annual Dota 2 tournament that takes place on a stage bigger than my ego. It's a spectacle that unites players from around the world, and a reminder that we're all just nerds chasing our dreams.\n\nSo, if you have a thick skin, a thirst for competition, and a masochistic desire to subject yourself to the whims of the Dota gods, jump right into Dota 2. Just don't forget to stock up on snacks and prepare for the emotional rollercoaster that awaits. Remember, victory tastes sweeter when it's seasoned with the tears of your enemies.

Time wasted just to feel bad because your team doesn't wanna play the game. Why do i have to subject myself to this abuse any further ? \n\nSpent most of my childhood growing up with dota1(5.84c), HoN(early acess) and d2.\nRead every patch and play each of the changes to heroes/items/maps/interactions whenever it releases.\nMet a lot of good mannered players and became friends,play together all the time too, but as life happens, and the timing that you can play together are not match so you gotta solo and it's not fun without friends because their play style would match your tempo or vice versa.\n\nIf you solo now either in rank or unrank, people would just play on their own and no communications at all, and even if you did communicate, they would ignore or pretend they never see your message and then their reaction to incoming fight is so infuriating slow that if you ping/tell them too much, they will hit items or come back to defend after half your base is gone. What is the point of communicating then ? \n\nThe community i felt is so ego inflated over so many years of dota that if you ping or say the wrong word, they would just curse your family and follow your hero around until the game is lost. No one is trying harder to win anymore, they just admit defeat whenever situations go unfavorable or bad.\n\nIf you are a loner, for the sake of your sanity and mental health, go play something else other than this. \nIf you have friends that can play long term together, try it out, it has steep learning curve to try out every patch together but either way this game is best played with friends and not alone.\n\nI came to love dota because of it's patches, every new heroes, skills changes, shard changes, every aspect of the game changes bit by bit but to the exception of fixing community's toxic behavior. \n\nAmidst the ebb and flow of countless patches and updates, I've traversed the storied landscapes of Dota 2\u2014a realm brimming with competition and strategy. From my initial forays into Dota 1 to the pinnacle of Dota 2's evolution, I've marveled at the nuanced shifts and adaptations that have kept the game pulsating with vitality. Yet, the persistent undertones of toxicity within the community's interactions have remained untouched, a jarring contrast to the game's evolutionary journey. As I approach the conclusion of this lengthy and demanding expedition, I now bid my farewell to the ever-changing backdrops and heroes of Dota2.\n\nThrough the tapestry of patches and iterations, I've been a firsthand witness to the metamorphosis of a beloved game. However, amid the whirlwind of updates, the enduring toxicity within the community continues to cast a shadow over the once-gleaming delight it brought. \n\nWith a profound sense of weariness and a heavy sigh, I bid adieu, Dota 2. The time has come for me to embark on a quest for new horizons and fresher realms.\n\nFarewell Dota 2.\n\nGood Luck and Have Fun !", "timestamp_created": 1692341981, "timestamp_updated": 1692341981, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537614703178405762", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 587528, "total_negative": 79618, "total_reviews": 667146}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwYYan3Zqq4E": "Sun Oct  1 12:16:22 2023"}}
