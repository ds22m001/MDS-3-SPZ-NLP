       "  'review': '[h1] Good Game [/h1]\\n\\nI finished this game in around six hours. I really enjoyed the art style. The animations, strange worlds and bosses were all nice to look at. The game has really simple gameplay consisting mostly of activating different devices in a certain order to get to the next area. The central mechanic was interesting(traveling in and out of different orbs to solve puzzles), unfortunately the puzzles only truly got me to think about them a few times and were never very difficult to figure out. i wish the game had focused a bit more on creating more complex or interesting puzzles to use the games central mechanic. maybe having optional side areas with more difficult puzzles could have provided a better challenge to someone like me that plays a lot of puzzle games\\n\\nThe central mechanic in this game reminds me of another puzzle game i have played Patricks Parabox, in comparison Cocoon feels more like style over substance. Patricks parabox in compaarison is much uglier but has much better designed puzzles using a similar central mechanic to cocoon but uses it much better by focusing solely on the puzzles and continuously added more and more complicated puzzles. Maybe if cocoon has spent a bit more time on the puzzles instead of the art styles it may have been more engaging. The final puzzle in cocoon is underwhelming because it is so easy. if the game had built on the challenge better and ended with a unique and challenging puzzle it would have left a much bigger impact on me\\n\\ni recommend if you think you would enjoy a pretty game with simple to novice puzzles. Might be great for you if you want a short pretty and simple experience',\n",

       "  'review': \"Beautiful yet short puzzle game by brilliant Jeppe Carlsen (of INSIDE fame). Every aspect of the game is polished and satisfying:\\n- The music elevates tension, guides the player and rewards when taking the right path/solving puzzles. \\n- The art style is a mesmerizing bio-mechanical and at times Escher-esque, all the while sneaking peeks of a vast unobtainable world. \\n- The puzzle design is simple and ramps up in complexity as the game progresses, I was was stumped for a while on one or two puzzles but on the whole felt it was mostly straightforward and easily understandable. I guess I would have liked some harder or more mind bending puzzles (though I am a fan of puzzle games and played quite a lot of them)\\n- As I've mentioned, the game is pretty short - finished it completely (including all achievements) in under 5 hours. On the one hand I fell like I would've liked more, yet on the other hand it was a very concentrated and curated experience. This is the only part where if you are not a fanatic of Carlsen's or of puzzle games might want to consider if the price to game to time ratio is enough for you. In my opinion it is very much worth my money.\\nA uniquely gorgeous experience, one that at least on the puzzle side is very close to portal, and transports you to an artfully imaginative world. Can't wait to see what Carlsen and his team create next!\",\n",

I only really had to think hard in the last 30mins or so, but that again is no real complaint. I suppose you could be critical that it follows the abstract-alien-puzzle-wordless setting thats is fairly common for these sort of games.. But it does it so well that I can forgive it!

       "  'review': \"I tumbled through COCOON in most of an evening and the early hours of the next morning, finishing the game in just under the 6 hour mark, compelled forwards by one of the most intriguing videogame worlds I've explored in a while. Before we get started: if I see a single complaint about this game being 'too short for the price', I'm going to explode; COCOON, like few other games, maximises every minute to show you something new, and reminds us what games can be when we take the risk to pursue the original.\\n\\nCOCOON reminds me of a number of games: the wide-eyed wonder and revelations of Outer Wilds, the pick-up-and-put-down trial-and-error puzzling of Wind Waker's later dungeons, the alien environment of... well, it's hard to pick just one, as COCOON journeys you through the macro and the micro, stretching your mind like taffy to comprehend where and when you might be. Without the strong environmental and art design holding it together, you'd get whiplash, but as it stands, worlds which begin novel become familiar over time - which, as it turns out, is key to the gameplay.\\n\\nThe puzzling premise, here, is diving in and out of glass orbs, each of which contains a world. To keep it as spoiler-free as possible, you soon discover these glass orbs are the core of your puzzling power, as well as the road your journey takes place on. Just as you feel you've discovered the limit of how they can be used, COCOON nudges you a little further, encouraging you to take that mental leap of faith to find a new path forwards.\\n\\nAnd it really is that - a polite nudge. At no point did I feel like I was headbutting a brick wall in my puzzle-solving. I'm an impatient puzzler, and struggle to get my head around layered puzzles, but COCOON is kind, ensuring I understood the bounds of each puzzle by limiting my area of play, and nearly all frustration is allayed by the feeling that the game wouldn't play tricks on me, or bait me with red herrings. I dislike puzzles of this sort, so if you do, too, you'll hopefully find COCOON is a good balance of puzzle versus progress.\\n\\nThere are some brief moments of true frustration, though. For instance, one series of solutions relied heavily on timing, which felt mildly incongruous with the puzzles up until that point. But it wasn't by any means enough to shatter my immersion: and what a world to be immersed in. \\n\\nCOCOON is minimalist. A 5-key control system has you absorbed within moments, the need to learn complex key-binds eliminated. COCOON toys with scale, colour, flora and fauna, perspective, shape, so on and so forth, to communicate lore in what is otherwise a wordless, speechless game, and it's at its best for it. \\n\\nCOCOON knows exactly what it is, does that extremely well, and leaves you as a player wondering what on earth - or not, as the case may be - you just experienced as you surface for air at its completion.\\n\\nIt's very good.\",\n",

Honestly want more and tougher puzzles (think they could've done a few more big ones at the end), these are pretty easy, but for a chill puzzle game with cool mechanics and honestly some REALLY good animation and art direction, a great time, it has a short, interesting story, not much of it I guess, which is fine, usually puzzle games struggle with that, although the end intrigues me for sure, hopefully a cocoon 2 eventually! Achievements were pretty easy as well. Oh also a small criticism is that it feels like it's going to be more open world but it is very linear, which is 100% fine, I just kept thinking there would be like a hub world with 4 different directions to go, but that wouldn't really work with what this game is trying to do. 9.5/10\",\n",

Annapurna Interactive sure knows how to pick who and what to publish because this game deserves all of the love that its getting. \\n\\nThere is legitimately not a single part of this game that I can knock. I don\\'t dislike any part of it and thats coming from someone that DESPISES puzzles and puzzle games. The puzzle design and general gameplay felt very good, forcing me to think outside the box a good bit but still very much playing within its own ruleset. \\n\\nThe best part of this game though is not the gameplay but the presentation, art direction and music all working in harmony. If you are a little wary that the trailers are just showing the good parts of the game? Yeah, those are the boring parts in the trailer, actually. There is a visual feast on display that absolutely blows you away when it gets paired with the atmospheric sound design and a fantastic soundtrack that really does a good job pacing the game out and setting the tone as you move through it. \\n\\nIt\\'s hard for a puzzle game to increase in complexity without getting overly complex, but Cocoon managed to not only increase the loose narrative stakes throughout the game, but it also gradually increased the complexity of puzzles in an impressive way that kept surprising me. I love how they used the mechanics like building blocks ending with some genuine brain tickling tests that force you to use all of the tools available to you and show that you were in fact not getting lucky up to that point, but understanding EXACTLY how the puzzle mechanics worked. That being said, it was again, very fair and unfrustrating to work through. \\n\\nFor completionists, there is a function after you beat the game that allows you to go back to any specific point in the game to acquire all of the things you were missing so don\\'t focus too hard on the extra stuff your first playthrough if you wanna get all achievements, just have a good time and enjoy yourself and you can go back later to find what you need. (It also has a statue that shows you where and what you are missing for the extra goodies so no need to guess where stuff is)\\n\\nI wish I had more to say beyond, \"Hey, this kicks ass\", but I don\\'t. This is precisely what is advertised on the outside of the box and does a great job at providing surprises the whole way through that keeps you intrigued and engaged. This is one of those sleeper games that won\\'t get mentioned come GOTY time but absolutely deserves a nod for being fantastic in 2023, a year that is jam PACKED with great games.\\n\\nEasily recommended. \\n\\nFollow my steam curator page for more reviews on indies like this, which helps.\\n\\n[code] https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42143664/ [/code]',\n",

If you have played the latter, you might remember my name from one of the achievements. I even had the honor of meeting Jeppe Carlsen, Jakob Schmid and some other (ex-)Playdead folk and I still cherish the memories of that night.\\n\\nWhen I heard that Carlsen had left Playdead to start his own studio, I was sad on one hand, because I had valued his puzzle design of their games as feeling integral to the world. But on the other hand, I felt excited for what was to come.\\n\\nKnowing Carlsen\\'s work well, I expected this game to put a huge emphasis on game feel and intuitive player guidance with excellent sound design and music integration. And this is pretty much what I got, but I did not, even after watching the trailers, expect this game to look so absolutely gorgeous all of the time on screen.\\n\\nThe game controls nice and fluid, everything can be done with eight directions and a single button. If you play on controller, you have analog movement controls but your character\\'s idle animation can only appear in said eight directions. The music is more calm and atmospheric but there are occasional intense sections in the soundtrack, fitting the action on screen.\\n\\nWhat really boggles my mind is the puzzle design. Knowing Carlsen, I did not expect any less, but the way in which mechanics are introduced to the player, consecutively in didactically designed challenges to the point where it feels completely natural to come up with the solution for the next puzzle made me speechless. There was never a time in the game where I felt lost or stuck, I always had the drive forward but at the same time, the puzzles always provided the right amount of challenge to me and did not seem trivial to solve.\\n\\nThere are very few very, very minor nitpicks that I still feel obliged to state here. The game starts with a \"cold start\" opening which is always cool, but from the player perspective, specifically on PC not always the best, since it prevents players from checking the game’s settings. As a result, the game started, at least for me, in 1080p and 60fps despite my monitor supporting 1440p 144fps and these gorgeous graphics deserve the crispest resolution you can offer them. The other slight issue I found was that some more frequent actions needed a held button press which felt just a tiny tad too long for my taste, to the point where I felt a slight bit of annoyance when I needed to do them often in succession. But as I said, these are absolute minor nitpicks, and the graphics options in the cold start can hopefully be fixed in a future patch.\\n\\nOther than that, I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this game. Its length and dramaturgical development with environmental storytelling combined with gameplay make for definitely the most compelling experience, by far, I\\'ve had with any game I played this year.\\n\\nVery highly recommended.',\n",

At around 3-4 hours to see the credits and $32 Can ($24 USD) price tag this is a premium experience. If you have cash to spare I can't recommend this game enough, but if you are worried about the $ to time spent equation this is a wait for a steep discount game.  \\n\\nI played on the steam deck and while not currently verified this game is a match made in heaven for a handheld console. The game ran flawlessly besides some noticeable fps drops in 2 cut scenes. These performance issues had no impact on game play. The only bugs I encountered are the intended ones such as the main character. \\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The puzzle/level design here is superb, head-scratching but not bruising. There's an almost nonstop variety of ideas; some conventional, many unlike anything else I've seen in a game before. I'd say it falters only the slightest bit when you're doing the sections that require you to activate symbols in the correct order, but even those aren't carbon copies of each other. Immersion has been polished to basically perfection, with zero loading screens after the first boot-up, unintrusive controls, and incredible sounding atmosphere and music. \\n\\nI would've loved a standout challenging final boss after how cool the previous ones were, though I was very satisfied with how the game wrapped up regardless. Any game that has excellent artistic merit while refusing to deprive us of creative and interesting gameplay should be praised.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The start seems a bit too simple for me, but it does pick up in complexity. I had hoped, it would be more like a pure puzzle game (somewhat like Patrick's Parabox maybe), but it's more of an adventure/exploration game with puzzles.\\nWhat bothers me is that the game won't let you experiment much. After solving a puzzle, you can't interact with the elements anymore, because they straight up dissolve or bridges and gates get closed. It feels a bit too guided for me because of this.\\nI'm not sure if it's too short, or if it's just right in length for what it is. [spoiler]The purple sphere wasn't utilized that much, especially in the end part of the game, which is kind of odd. It probably would have been more satisfying if it was used again[/spoiler]\\n[spoiler]There are also boss fights for some reason, lol. Didn't expect that at all, but they're also just puzzles with a fail state.[/spoiler]\\n\\nThe art and sound direction and the whole atmosphere of the game in general are absolutely phenomenal, though. Very very alien, with shapes, nobody could have ever imagined.\\n\\nOverall pretty decent game.\",\n",

It's got all the fun of setting up and operating successful businesses while using the drug theme as a way to keep it different and interesting. If you are looking for a business management/tycoon game that's not too overly complex, but still has a lot of depth to fine tune things, this is the game for you!\\n\\nBeen playing this game since the day it released into early access and I have loved every minute of it. There is just something super satisfying about setting up the factory and businesses and watching it all come together in harmony. It's also incredibly satisfying to start off with just a basic set up and watch it grow into a empire with multiple drug types and tiers.\\n\\nI also personally enjoy the art style of the game. It gives a somewhat simple feel to the game while still including enough details to really see whats happening in the world.\\n\\nTo sum it all up, DNFC is an amazing business management game themed around drug trade. It's incredibly satisfying to play, visually pleasing to look at, and has a banger soundtrack to boot.\\n\\nI seriously cannot recommend this game enough.\",\n",

As it is I wouldn't recommend it. Definitely not good for beginner players of this genre, doesn't really explain much just kinda drops you in, gives you a few directions, and then lets you have at it. Couldn't really figure out what to do, my employees started dying of starvation, my lamps started breaking, and I had no input as to how to fix either. Wouldn't let me hire engineers like I thought you would need to do to fix the lights, and wouldn't let me add snack machines which I thought would be what you need to put down to feed your employees. Overall looks like there's a lot of good, but needs a good bit of work and definitely a better tutorial for people just getting into this genre of game.

       "  'review': \"This game is definitely a good start to a tycoon game. Knowing that it's in early access, I am looking forward to more expansion on narcotics trade as a whole. There are so many challenges that could be added in, from DEA raids, selling to cops and being punished, dealing with customers who are active in addiction then go to rehab so you lose sales, and investigations from the government. \\n\\nAs it stands, [i]Definitely Not Fried Chicken[/i] trends in a way that seems to glamorize the cartel lifestyle, without showing the really heinous parts of drug manufacturing and use. I am not displeased with the weed part of the game, its fun for the most part. Making edibles and prerolls would be a cool addition, as well as a campaign to legalize so you can have a legit store like we do in the better parts of the U.S. \\n\\nWith the meth update, that's where my liking of this game went south. Knowing someone who has recovered from meth abuse, this is [i]insultingly[/i] simplified. Meth is a serious drug that ruins lives and families, its not so easy that people can just buy it once and wait. They should be pounding on the door for it. There should be tweakers busting into cars and robbing stores, I want to see the *real* things that go down with the drug industry, as it stands now, there just isn't enough depth.\\n\\nI hope the devs can learn from people who are either in active addiction or have become sober. There is so much more to this lifestyle that is completely omitted. It seems like a game made by a fan of Breaking Bad, not someone who has [i]any[/i] knowledge of how the illicit drug world works whatsoever.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b]Definitely Not Fried Chicken  was featured on my YouTube channel[/b]\\n\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3017965615\\n\\n\\nand now onto the short review\\n\\n[h1]TL;DR Review[/h1]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n//intro//\\n\\nWelcome back comrades, this is MF Kraven & you are watching less than 10 mins reviews. The Youtube series where I take a look at games i think seem cool & give my thoughts on them in less than 10 mins. I review games in the following format, Buy it Now! Wait for Sale & Do Not Buy!\\n\\nToday I\\'m gonna be taking a look at an EARLY ACCESS version Definitely Not Fried Chicken, a business management sim with a Break Bad twist. Start off as a humble entrepreneur hiring local inner-city farmers & chemists then buy out lots to launder I mean invest in Laundromats, Donut Shops, Fried Chicken & Seafood restaurants. (Night Clubs & Casinos coming at a later date). Have your base of operations distribute your narcotics throughout the city while in competition with a chicken icon in The Major. Could you be this quaint town\\'s new kingpin? Or is DNFC Definitely Not a Good time? Lets find out.\\n\\n\\n\\n//Graphics, Sound & Artstyle//\\n\\nThere\\'s a grimy box pixel art type of aesthetic that perfectly suits this game, the sfx are phenomenal- while a bit repetitive at times, I can clearly hear when my workers are being productive with as much going on. Its welcoming to be able to make it out. The music, just doesn\\'t resonate with me.\\n\\n\\n//Gameplay//\\n\\nIf you like a meticulous micromanagement business sim, this is the one for you. Hire workers for your growhouse from Peons, Engineers, Cleaners and even security. Set their schedules so they dont burn out but also enough to produce product to move. Get a few garages to send your product on mopeds, have them go to specific customers in a map & route them out. Don\\'t like only sending one pound of product? Send some over to the junkyard to unlock cars & trucks to move even more product. Want to grow different strains or even get in the more lucrative field of narcotics? Send some over to the university & they\\'ll start selling you their stuff. But surely with as much money as you will be making, people will notice right? Buy out lots & build business to keep the fuzz off your back- or also distribute directly to customers from your business. Set schedules for your business and make passive income the.. legal way. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n//Price//\\n\\n24.99 USD\\n\\n\\n//How many hours estimated//\\n\\nI\\'m only about 6.5 hours in, and ive only touched the surface I believe. Its a slow grind but very much one of those, let me just get 15 more mins in type of games.\\n\\n\\n//Is it Playable on Steamdeck?//\\n\\nWhile it is playable, I wouldn\\'t recommend it for SteamDeck. You have to be meticulous about your scheduling and going back & forth between lots until you have that perfect schedule set that allows you to bring enough income in to warrant leaving it alone. \\n\\n\\n//Wishlist//\\n\\n*Ability to move rooms, as of now you have to kind of completely renovate everything\\n*Promotions- giving the ability for workers to make other workers take a break or open businesses without you.\\n*More vehicles for transporting product, 2 & 3 package vehicles like smaller car or a bigger moped that can load 2\\n*Options to start selling higher quality narcotics at start, I couldn\\'t open a restaurant because I hadn\\'t unlocked the equipment to make the harder stuff.\\n*the ability to rename workers, & shops\\n*you setting the hours for your businesses, I mean I grew up around shady 24 hr Laundromats & Donut Shops.\\n*setting prices. for the product, for the washing machines, dryers, gumball machines, detergent. setting the prices a bit higher would be nice.\\n*multiple businesses on a single lot. lets say like a strip mall where you can take your dry cleaning to, can grab a donut & maybe even an arcade \\n*more business types! like i mentioned, dry cleaning, arcade, skating rink, mattress stores, just a bunch of business types that everyone questions how they\\'re in business despite never seeing anyone in there.\\n*better UI\\n*finally, more drug types. \\n\\n\\n\\n//Final Thoughts//\\n\\nI absolutely love Definitely Not Fried Chicken. The silly animations, the in depth mechanics, I spent a hell of a lot longer making my laundromat the way I wanted it though, while I allowed the factory or grow-house to just do whatever they wanted (i did have to hire a few workers when I did check back at the grow-house because id work em to death). I\\'m about 7 hours in and I still haven\\'t even made my donut, chicken or seafood restaurant, I love the hard grind but therein lies some problems.\\n\\nWith workers, their needs are always deteriorating. But if you don\\'t have em on a scheduled break they just wont do anything. I\\'ve set a system for my business with Schedule 0,1,2. On 0 they work from 0600 to 1900 but if i see they\\'re unhappy i will switch em over to 1, with is basically break time all day except for 2000 to 23000 when it\\'s time to receive a package from my growhouse, 2 is to send em home. I\\'m still tinkering with scheduling but that seems to be the best for me yet sometimes it\\'s a bit overwhelming. If I go over to improve the growhouse and forget to open the Laundromat then i miss on having passive income that has certainly helped me. Why not leave it open then you ask? Because my machines need maintenance every single day, so I hire an engineer to come and fix em. Cant exactly bring him over when I forget to switch him over to schedule 0. I\\'d love little reminders or even a \"phone call or text\" from my workers to say \"hey boss are we open today or nah\". Any prompt really. I\\'d also love to have a ranking system for workers. Like they can level up and be supervisor, manager etc to give them a bit more responsibility & help your crew in need. Why cant the cleaner who just stands around when she\\'s done also accept product? It\\'s not like they dont clean the warehouse where we keep narcotics?\\n\\nAlso while I\\'m enjoying the long grind, it seems pretty daunting to unlock everything you need to make more money. 90 pts or 45 packages of good weed or 90 packages of bad weed to unlock a car! Now that I\\'ve replaced my mopeds with cars, I don\\'t always have enough product to move. The dispatch system also seems kinda broken. If we get so much hands on work, why not allow our dispatchers to deliver certain kind of product to one customer and while having another one highlighted deliver the rest to that one? Once you get a hotline, customers will light it up to get you to deliver to them, its only until recently however that i realized i could charge more for a promise of better quality product. \\n\\nAnd if I\\'m being completely honest, ive been having a HELL of a good time just running my little laundromat. Getting all the permits to get the absolute best equipment, maximizing my passive income, while also managing the workers there. I almost forget, oh yeah we\\'re running a drug line here \\n\\n\\nAs a shell, this game has the potential to be one of the greatest of all time. So good on the devs for releasing this in EA. While it is almost finished besides adding (ocaine, nightclubs & casinos) the game would be a LOT better with some tweaks (no pun intended) here and there. I have a wishlist since Jan, so for me this is def worth a buy However buyer be warned that this is an extremely niche title.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI guess it\\'s a tricky one but if you were on the fence about getting it, BUY IT NOW! & if you\\'re just shopping around, WAIT FOR SALE! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[h1]Buy it Now![/h1]\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The first being that you cant really have the Moon meth because it needs Vaccum and this vaccum kills everyone that doesnt wear a Astronauts helmet which is very expensive. The second one is the problem with the loading past 75% or not being able to employ new workers for some reason or just the bugs that make the game unplayable.

       "  'review': 'Great game. At its core, it\\'s a resource management and supply lines game. \\n\\nAt this point in development, it is very reminiscent of someone\\'s free-to-play flash-game passion-project. There\\'s a lot there, it\\'s fun, it\\'s creative, but it\\'s jank and very little QOL implemented. But there\\'s a lot of potential, and the devs are active in development. \\n\\nSpeaking to the inevitable early-access jank:\\nAfter running for 2 or 3 hours it gets glitchy and the AI bugs-out and build-mode gets funky. Everything breaks down, but it is still technically playable, just the AI might keep going around in circles or walk around the entire property to use the rear door rather than walk out back. If you enter build-mode and place some rooms, the price will stick on your mouse through gameplay until you go back into build-mode and select then de-select remove room tool. At least, that\\'s the fastest way I\\'ve found to fix that. Also, when placing room tiles, the flooring textures won\\'t change. You\\'ll have a dirty, earthen floor until you restart the game. Then everything fixes itself and the floors appear properly and the AI behaves normally. \\nIf any of these things happen, it\\'s definitely worth a restart as the others are not far behind.\\n\\nThe QOL mechanics are bare-bones. So much is missing from it, as other reviews have pointed-out. Transporting your goods via vehicles seems like an okay system at first, but there is very little customization to it, no custom labeling to easily tell one from another, no customizing their loads numerically (you can flag it open to multiple drugs, but how much is added of each is random and up to the AI, which is also randomly performing whatever tasks you\\'ve flagged for them), etc. They will depart from your \"factory\" only when full, and will attempt to stop at the chosen destination. If it can\\'t, it\\'ll keep circling the block until there\\'s space. Once it reaches its destination it will sit there until others unload it. If you are trying to ship resources to one of your businesses, and the shelf storage for a particular drug is full, the vehicle will sit there indefinitely until space is freed and the last drug is unloaded from the vehicle, or if you manually tell it to return to the factory. That can REALLY fuck with your supply-chain. Also, since flagging a vehicle to multiple drugs just lets the AI randomly load things into it (no numerically customization), it\\'s DEFINITELY worth buying a separate vehicle and using only a single drugs per vehicle. That gets to be an expensive upkeep, but that\\'s the best system I\\'ve found. Also, once you have enough drugs to make that especially expensive, you\\'ve probably making a whole lot of money, anyway. Businesses make a good profit, even without your drugs. The Laundromat, not-so-much (it\\'s a laundromat. No expensive dry-cleaning, just the cheap washers and dryers, and the businesses all have a maximum capacity determined by the star-rating. That is another complain of mine. Bustling businesses are a myth because of this maximum capacity that is enforced, regardless of accomodations).\\nI\\'d LOVE to see a blue-print system implemented into the game. Construction can get tedious, and I find myself constantly looking back to my older businesses to look at the design I thought worked well so I can copy that over to the new business. Cut/copy/paste would also be great. Moving a room as a whole, extending a wall, etc. What they got works, but it\\'s missing some QOL improvements. Looking at this, I\\'ve really taken The Sims building mode for granted.\\n\\nIt\\'s still early-access, and the developers are active. That\\'s promising. This game has a lot of potential, and I\\'d hate to see it abandoned any time soon.',\n",

Once you get more than 5-6 products unlocked the game becomes super stuttery, takes several seconds to load when you snap back to your lab. With that said, my replay-ability was decent as i wanted to do it better the next time. Once they unlock more with Early Access ill revisit for sure. But once you start making enough money, there isn't a lot to do. I have almost abandoned drugs at this point and just opened a bunch of restaurants.

As the saying goes, all that glitters isn\\'t gold; and in DNFC, all that fries certainly isn\\'t chicken.\\n\\nIn DNFC, you\\'re no mere observer. Instead, you\\'re an active participant in the bustling cityscape, donning the dual hat of a respected entrepreneur and a secretive narcotics mogul. DNFC\\'s tutorial offers you a compass to navigate this complex labyrinth. However, like a master painter with a canvas, it provides you the tools but leaves the masterpiece creation to you.\\n\\nThe game\\'s charm is skillfully baked into its attention to detail. Each decision, from buying plots for your drug compound, mapping production lines, to orchestrating distribution routes, impacts your empire. Couple this with the task of safeguarding your operations from prying eyes, and you have an intricate, immersive world that rewards both strategy and creativity.\\n\\nYet, the game’s essence doesn\\'t lie solely in the clandestine operations. The vibrant townsfolk, with their outrageous demands, add a splash of color to your journey. Fulfilling their eccentric requests not only unlocks secret costumes but also provides an enjoyable respite from your core operations, amplifying DNFC’s appeal.\\n\\nMaintaining your cover through proper management of your \\'legal\\' businesses is just as crucial. Whether it\\'s streamlining your kitchen staff\\'s efficiency, scheduling the unloading of trucks, or ensuring customer satisfaction, every detail pulls you deeper into DNFC\\'s meticulously crafted narrative.\\n\\nGranted, DNFC is in early access, and there are still pieces of this intriguing puzzle to be unveiled. However, this doesn\\'t detract from the game\\'s current allure. Instead, it whets your appetite for what\\'s yet to come.\\n\\nHaving clocked a whopping 56.9 hours, it\\'s clear that DNFC is more than a mere tycoon/management sim. It\\'s a game that stirs your entrepreneurial instincts, challenges your strategic skills, and rewards you with a rich, immersive experience that is equal parts exciting and rewarding.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you\\'re hunting for a management sim that offers an audacious twist on the genre, Definitely Not Fried Chicken is your answer. With its rich narrative, engaging gameplay, and beautifully crafted world, it\\'s a digital playground you won\\'t want to leave!\\n\\nScore: 9.5/10 - [i]\"A sublime journey into the glitz and glamour of the 80s, where running a business is as thrilling as it is rewarding. Don\\'t miss out on this rollercoaster of a game!\"[/i]',\n",

The concept is fantastic, reminiscent of managing a storefront for a underground business, and it instantly struck a chord with me.\\n\\nEven though it is still in Early Access, the game shows great promise and is already worth every penny. The developers have managed to capture the essence of fun and deliver an engaging experience. From the moment I started playing, I found myself immersed in the world of running a quirky, yet captivating, establishment while building my underground empire.\\n\\nThe gameplay is a load of fun, and I have thoroughly enjoyed exploring the various challenges and intricacies of managing a chicken-themed business. The attention to detail and the humor infused throughout the game truly enhance the overall experience.\\n\\nI am genuinely excited to see how Definitely not Chicken Fried evolves throughout its Early Access journey. With such a strong start, I have high hopes for its future updates and refinements. If you're a fan of management games whit a shady twist, this game is an absolute must-try.\\n\\nOverall, Definitely not Chicken Fried is a gem in Early Access, offering a delightful blend of nostalgia, promising gameplay, and loads of fun. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an enjoyable and engaging gaming experience.\\n\\n[b]Score: 9/10[/b]\",\n",

Then cram as many scooter drives as you possibly can until you unlock cars by delivering to the scrap yard. \\n\\nThere is plenty to keep you occupied for now, but I'm excited for the additional content to be added during early access. So far there seems to be 3 weed variants and meth (so you can go full Breaking Bad). Coca is shown as coming during EA, but I sure hope they go way further with the production lines available to you. All of that being said, there is much more variety in front businesses you are able to run than production lines at the moment. I'll be revisiting this game regularly.\",\n",

I even waited for an update before leaving a review in hope it was coming. \\nThis is a HUGE issue and its been an issue since release. There's even another review that the developers responded to saying they were looking into it. That was nearly 7 months ago and its still not fixed. Until it is. I don't recommend it. Early access games are bound to have issues but not being able to access the game should be the number one concern. Just wait for the full release and hopefully it will be fixed at that point.\\n\\nUpdate: Game full released today and I tested all the saves. Still not loading past 75%\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Its a good game. I feel it does need some major adjustments before it becomes playable though. I feel like doors should only take up the square they swing out to. I think you don't earn enough money from the game, I think the values need to be increased slightly by around 1-5$ per transaction. I think that one major issue is that people don't show up to work on time, If I send people home and their work starts at 8 they shouldn't be rolling in at 9:37 and me still be paying them for an hour of work that didn't happen. I feel like there needs to be more than 6 schedules, maybe 6 schedules for each type of worker. I think that you should also be able to prioritize tasks. Ex. This employee will run the register, if no customer's are around he will prep chicken and fries. My biggest pet peeve is that I feel I cannot make a profit unless I am constantly adjusting everything my employees are doing. I feel once I set up my entire shop and get things running it should stay running unless a disaster strikes or I over value something like no time for food. Finally, if an employee has nothing to do they should use that time to use the break room and fix their stats. Its a really fun and creative game, with extreme potential. Disregard this comment if the updates patch these things out.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Fun game. Love sim games that let you build your own custom workshops and have workers assigned to jobs.\\n\\nUnderstand this is an early access review as of 6/24/23 \\nSeems like there is going to be a lot more added in the future that will make even better automation possible and better production as well. \\n\\nMy current gripes about the game are relatively small but here are some I wish would be implemented\\n1. Exit to Main Menu Button. Not just an exit game button.\\n2. Dispatch groups and auto dispatching so I don't have to open the dispatch menu every 10 seconds to assign separate vehicles to make deliveries. I would like them to complete and assign them on their own but also have a separate grouping for delivering to businesses only or time limited deliveries.\\n3. Time speed at max speed still feels too slow. Especially early game this can lead to a lot of just sitting on the phone and waiting for income to be able to do anything at all which is not fun.\\n4. As of right now there is no event I have come across besides the opening one getting attacked by a rival business/former employer and the annoying rocket ship guys who will ask for a delivery and if you say no they will pester you every 3 minutes. Please add more asap even just defending the drug warehouse from a couple guys with bats or something.\\n5. Maybe a send employees home button for when there are fires as closing the shop only keeps customers out and the employees will mindlessly walk into the flame so either I fire them to send them home, waste a limited schedule space to send them home, or let them burn. Please add maybe a fire extinguisher, sprinklers, or a call fire department button maybe? Also adding a send home button would be nice if you need to save some income early on rough days or when accidentally overspending. \\n6. Maybe a story about overthrowing other rival businesses that pop up in the neighborhood as you progress by opening your own outlets.\\n\\nSo far the game has been fun but short as of right now but looking forward to the full release. :)\",\n",

I know you get a little bit more for timed orders(which should be double or triple since its such a short amount of time) but this needs to change.\\n-Lower the cost of appliances. It shouldn\\'t cost $50 per appliance a day to run some heaters/lights/etc. Not so much a problem later in the game but those costs add up when you\\'re riding the struggle bus early game.\\n-Tweaks to the monuments. The building that gives you longer work hours could be changed so there is an unlock for 24/7 business operation.\\n-Timed missions and phone orders need to be worked out better. Why timed side missions for special customers? They keep asking you to complete the orders anyways after rejecting them so why not just take the timer away.\\n-When you buy a piece of land for the factory the price of the next land purchase increases. Could just have every piece of land for the factory be $10,000 a piece. The entire main square would still cost almost $500,000 with that price point.\\n-AOE needs to be better for everything. I don\\'t want to put 3+ large heaters/ac units/humidifiers/etc into a small room for the 3 star rating when it should only take 1 or 2 of them.\\n-AC/Heater/Lights/Etc should all cap at 100 instead of the different numbers they are currently capped at. This could tie into the AOE mentioned above for better coverage.\\n\\nBreaking Bad/10\\n\\n*edit: added bug*',\n",

       "  'review': \"I picked up this game last week and have been really enjoying it! \\n\\nIt's still in early access but there is a lot that you can do to have fun in the game. I strongly enjoy this game but do have some ideas for the developers after playing for a bit.\\n\\nRe-playability: I would really really really enjoy seeing this concept fleshed out a bit more in depth. I feel like the game progression in your vision is to Grow Weed -> Cook Meth -> Produce Coke. I propose a concept of choose your end-game where you can flesh out each drug empire as their own path. IF a player wishes, they can dabble in multiple drug trades. However I would find it very interesting if you could get to End-Game while fine-tuning one of the drug trades. \\n\\nExample: The Cannabis production -  Stretch it out \\n\\nThe player is able to go from Cannabis to Toasted and Amazonian very quickly and it doesn't take much to get the balance of heat/humidity for 3 Star Product lines. Leaving the next logical path to delve into the Meth trade, but what If it was an option to continue evolving your Cannabis instead of migrating to meth. \\n\\n4 Progression Trees - \\n\\n1st Tree is Empire - Works as currently set up where you can progress to each trade and get 3 Instances of Each Product line for 9 options. \\n2nd Tree is Grower - Unlocks a 4th and 5th Cannabis types but blocks off the 3rd Instance of Meth/Coke. 9 options\\n3rd Tree is Chemist - Unlock a 4th and 5th Meth type but blocks off 3rd Instances of Cannabis/Coke   9 options\\n4th Tree is Socialite - Unlocks a 4th and 5th Coke type but blocks off 3rd Instance of Cannabis/Meth   9 options\\n\\nProgression can work similarly to Junk Yard/Uni/Guns where you send delivery out for skill points but you must purchase upgrades in order. First x amount of points unlocks the choice of a progression tree. The 4th and 5th products of each trade can be more complicated to get the right balance of temperatures/humidity/light (smaller thresholds) \\n\\nStaff - \\n\\nI enjoy managing the staff for each establishment but having to adjust the schedule can be tedious, Would love some options to click/drag to change states so we can make a full schedule easier without so much clicking. \\n\\n\\n\\n5/5 - This game is awesome for a Early Access game and I very much look forward to more like this!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"A interesting concept for a game but it feels like a alpha at best. \\n\\n1st the game is absurdly slow with progression you will spend entire days with the game just running at max speed to make enough money to do anything, because employee limits are tied to land which is expensive to start you'll grow your operation so slowly that you wish something, anything would happen but this leads to the next problem. Combind with how worthless your vehicles are til upgraded you've got alot of running the game in the background.\\n\\n2, Nothing ever happens; There's only 2 scripted events in the game where you can even be attacked from what I can tell, both times tied to progress. Both of these attacks are not only completely unwinnable even if every single employee is a guard but there's a entire gameplay mechanic around hiring these guards and outfitting them, which you will never do since even if you could get attacked you don't have the employee limits to maintain any kind of force unless your leaving the game on overnight to afford half a coffee shop.\\n\\n3, Logistic wise its nonexistant. You can't name routes, or vehicles, or set even the most basic of import limits for them to follow. So lets say you have a donut shop which is selling all 3 kinds of weed, you have space to store 12 of each. If you have 12 of #1, 10#2 and 0 of #3 and the vehicle pulls up with 1 of #1 and you got nowhere to put it, it will sit there forever til space is availible. This creates huge bottlenecks, which lead to workers sitting idle, customers complaining you don't have the right things availible for purchase, ect. \\n\\n4, AI workers work about 90% of 50% of the time. Your only control over workers is what hours they work, and what tasks and rooms they can be in. You can't prioritize any task over another e.g. Only haul to drivers if you have no Weed #2 related jobs availible, ect you can only say do both and it's random what they'll do. \\n\\nA good example of this is mechanics who will ignore broken machines (which the game won't tell you why, supposedly theres a 20 tile radius they work in and what that means exactly is never explained) as they wander around randomly even directly past broken equiptment and you can only set room groups for them to work in, so you'd think it would be all the devices in those rooms right? Wrong. \\n\\n5 Lastly, setting up your actual base is also a pita. There's no options to manually make walls dividing rooms or the like. So in the case of say Weed #2 and Weed #3 having conflicting requirements you'll need to seperate them by building completely superflous rooms with empty land inbetween instead of using a simple divider. Doing this spreads the base out further, which breaks the AI further. Most objects need the area infront of them completely unobstructed and can't share this space, which results in needing huge rooms to tetris objects in despite there being no reason why you can't make a trash can and soda machine can both face the same empty tile.\\n\\nI could go on about a laundry list of other issues, customer complaints that you can't do anything about decoration (cuz it doesn't exist) or tempature (doesn't affect people), quest's that have absurdly short deadlines that are near impossible to do without express knowledge their about to happen like npc Jack asking for 20 of something in 10 in game minutes (hope you got 3 unused trucks and 4 pallets worth of it ready it's failed with a complete loss of all your stuff), ect ect. \\n\\nMaybe in couple years of dev this might be worth playing if they completely redo about 2/3 of the systems, but that's gonna be alot of work.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Not going to lie watching and playing are 2 very different experiences. \\n\\nThe game UI is REALLY BAD. Honestly watch someone play and just look at the U.I. and imagine yourself fumbling through it to get anything done. It's unbearably forgettable and unclear. I had to do the tutorial 2 times just to remember how to put up walls. Then the remove walls and put up walls buttons both highlight for put up walls making it even more confusing, and then sometimes instead of making a room it will delete a room haha. Honestly whats wrong with the brain of whoever designed this!\\n\\nSo outside of the U.I. being super unfun to navigate, the game isn't even all that fun. Navigating from the map, to making your stores, to managing deliveries and scheduling routes/employee hours/open close is really not satisfying. The only time i felt even a little bit of that business owner enjoyment was getting a laundry mat to tier 3 and watching the happiness go up a bit along with going to 4 stars. It was only temporary though as there doesn't really feel like a goal. \\n\\nHonestly my final thoughts are that they couldn't seem to capture what makes a simulator game fun. This one is a bit too tedious, doesn't look great, doesn't give any feeling of reward honestly, and everything feels super arbitrary. There are way way better simulation games out there, hell i've played better ones on my phone. this just isn't it.\",\n",

Put it all together, it instantly set alight, killing ALL of my employees. So that's fine, my error, I didn't realise the kitchen needs to be minimum -30 degrees (which is silly in the first place). So built it all again, put the fryers down that I'd bought, that were low health, and it instantly caught fire AGAIN. Unless I sell them and buy NEW fryers there's no way to deal with this. It seems like an awkward work around and honestly I really can't be bothered now. I stomache'd through a lot of issues, the clunky UI because I enjoyed the gameplay loop but that's really taken me out of it and genuinely made me angry.\\n\\nAs above, I'll reconsider this review upon release.\",\n",

I would love more options with decorations including walls, floors, indoor dec. One thing that annoyed me the most is that whenever I move a plant or a shelf I lost everything in it. Staff limit is pointless, nobody tells me in a real business how many people I can employ. \\nI played with many EA games but this one shouldn`t even be out yet.

Yes.

Engineers will pace back a forth trying to get to a couple of things to repair but will never make it to any of them while the rest of you factory disintegrates because the engineer is stuck. I\\'ve had workers randomly start working jobs they aren\\'t assigned to. The order of your employees and drivers in the UI will change after you save & exit the game then come back later. Managing deliveries becomes very tedious once you have a bunch of drivers and there is no automation to deliveries. If one of your business\\' stock room fills up while you aren\\'t watching? Well that driver will sit in front of the business forever waiting to be unloaded. The UI is clunky and missing some basic features like \"exit to menu\". You have to exit to windows then relaunch if you want to get to the main menu. Again, there is a lot of potential and I wish I could keep playing it, but I hope the developer focuses on getting the core of the game working well before adding more content because the content isn\\'t going to matter when basic things don\\'t work.',\n",

Its a fun management game with enough aspects to it to keep me occupied with a youtube video. Wish there was a faster time skip as it is not suuper fast, especially during night. Don't AFK the game once you get a consistent positive income stream till you get max SP and money, it will take away from the game. I say, make more legal buisnesses, make more illegal buisnesses. Maybe add some competition making you lower your price to compete or fight the competition, possibly killing your guards. What im seeing negatively is just a lack of factors. The stuff added is fun and functional, just make it a full game and the small amount of content addition that I see isnt going to do that.

Its an extremely easy game to beat and i really dont see how bringing in cocaine will change this. \\n\\nThere are almost zero \"events\" and the \"story\" outside the tutorial is basically nonexistent. There is nothing to overcome, no goals, no challenges. Further i have a massive operation, i have 54 factory workers and i produce more drugs than my 10 shops can sell. Even with a massive operation im only using 1/3 of the allowed build space for my factory. There is no need for the rest. When coke comes in i will need to buy 1 plot that is it. \\n\\nI almost feel like i was ripped off. This could port to mobile and fit right in. Its right on the boarder of being an idle clicker game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This game hits so many right buttons for me that I have to recommend it. While there are plenty of problems and updates don't come out at a regular pace, I still believe this is worth a buy even at its current state. \\n\\nWhere this game does right is the idea of building and maintaining both a lab and a front or fronts for your business of NOT selling chicken. Usually you'd only be in charge of procuring and then distributing product, well now you also get to make a KFC to sell less than legitimate products alongside some tasty chicken. This is great and it pleases my simple brain when I do, finally, manage to create a positive cash flow.\\n\\nWhere this game doesn't quite hit the mark is from a number of ongoing issues. There are a number of bugs that can effectively keep you from playing. Usually these are resolved by relauching the game, but having to do so multiple times per hour can become a real chore. This only becomes more tedious when loading times can be seen as on the long side(I currently have it on an SSD and it still takes a minute or two to get the game launched and back into my current save file.) \\n\\nLastly, is a certain amount of imbalances in the game itself. At the start the tutorial gives you a rundown of how to start and maintain a business/front. These are relatively charming and simple to understand as you go. However, it has a way of kicking you into the lions den the moment it's over. You help repair and restart a business for another company and the moment you finish the business portion of the tutorial you get fired on the spot. The tutorial takes this chance to introduce you to your very own Sal lawyer guy as the explanation of the Not chicken side of things. The problem with this is the fact that it doesn't set you up for success as soon as they are done feeding you this side of things. You have a barely functioning 'Not chicken' lettuce supply and nothing else, it doesn't urge you to build a business outside of vaguely mentioning the teaching guides on the top before leaving you on your own. \\n\\nTutorial aside this is the least of your worries at the start. You have only a production of 'lettuce' and no fronts, so now what? Well it gives you access to a group of bikes to deliver product, so that should be enough right? Sadly this is another point for imbalance. Your first orders over the request system is for eight pieces of 'Definitely Not Fried Chicken' each and each job has an output of somewhere between eight and nine hundred dollars. Great! However your starting bikes can only hold one piece of lettuce and makes for horribly slow progress. This becomes only worse when you sell your first piece of lettuce from a front(if you manage to get so far as to start the first of the 'optional' side tutorials) and find that each piece of lettuce sold is worth almost four hundred dollars! So this basically makes any deliveries to these requests completely unprofitable. \\n\\nTL;DR \\n\\nWhere this game may have issues and I have a better ability to describe faults than praises due to my own inexperience with other management games like this to compare it to, it still manages to draw me in and peak my interest. I recommend it because it has so much potential and I want nothing more than to see where it goes as the developers put more love and care into it. \\n\\nAfter thought:\\n\\nI was made to write this after discovering the strange disconnect between front lettuce money gain and the requests. This was such a huge problem that I had to put it somewhere! Please, developers, this is among your biggest issues that isn't the usual complaint about locked content. The balance between requests and fronts is astronomical and at the beginning the ability to actually survive as nothing but a dealer of 'not fried chicken' without a front is completely impossible without the access to trucks.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This one of those games that has potential, it's just not quite there yet. I'll explain.\\n\\nRight now it's two main issues are, lack of content (but there is plenty planned.) and issues with general game logic.\\nThe lack of content is pretty much a guaranteed when considering Early Access titles, so I'll give this issue a free pass. However, there needs to be some major changes logic-wise in order for me to turn this frown upside down.\\n\\nThe building system is, how should I put it, rudimentary at best. There are certain exclusion zones around items that do not need to exist. For example, each tile can only hold one object, the tile adjacent to the object is it's 'interaction zone', you cannot place objects within an interaction zone, or overlap interaction zones. This is a big issue as, for example, doors have an interaction zone on either side. Thus making the building of rooms clunky. You can't, for example, put a door next to a microwave, a UV light (which hangs from the ceiling) over a planter and plenty more other small, yet highly frustrating issues.\\n\\nThe logistics system is similarly frustrating. If your business fills up on a particular stock, lets say regular cannabis, the car delivering 2 units of Cannabis, 1 unit of Toasted and 1 unit of Amazonian will sit there forever until you eventually sell 2 units of regular Cannabis and the vehicle is now empty. This clogs up the system and is highly inefficient, with larger logistics vehicles planned this will only get worse. \\nWhat it should do is make a check to see if the assigned stores are full and if so, return to the depot or go to the next delivery assignment. Better yet, have the store check for what it needs and make the request from the factory to begin with.\\n\\nWorkers need a priority list of assignments. If there are customers waiting to be served and a logistics vehicle waiting to be emptied and you only have limited employees, the player should be able to decide which they want to tackle first. Rather than have to employ far more employees than necessary to cover all bases at all times. Just as with the logistics, this is highly inefficient.\\n\\nRight now, I cannot recommend this game. Within a few hours I've pretty much seen all there is to see and spotted a few major issues that will grind the game down as more content is added. As far as the gameplay loop is concerned, it's great. It just needs a lot more mechanical refinement and about another year or two in the oven before it's ready. I don't regret spending the money as I see good potential in the future.\",\n",

I wouldn't recommend to get the game at its current state as it has a long way to go because apparently its an early access launch within an early access.\\n\\nYou get 3 front businesses to setup and run, 3 types of weed production and 1 type of meth production and that's it. The rest is locked away in early access hahaha! The game at its core is pretty fun. By setting up the fried chicken business you get to feel like you're the boss of Los Pollos Hermanos. Other than that, the delivery of product needs a lot of work. If not micromanaged, the products will get delivered to the wrong store. There is a garage indicator on the map but it doesn't show which is a car or a moped right until it leaves out for delivery. Workers may stop working, the UI is basic and pretty straight forward. Doesn't take too long getting used to it. Graphics are okay as the main focus is production and delivery of products to your customers and how you can improvise and create a better and faster production line. I feel it should be more that just 4 worker slot for each plot purchased to produce your products. \\n\\nThere are a lot of improvements to be made to this game and I hope the devs will deliver the rest of the early access content soon and make more interesting content for the game. I will give this a thumbs up but I wouldn't want you to spend your money on something that is still baking.

The graphics are finger-lickin\\' good and the controls are crispy and responsive. The storyline is so juicy, I can\\'t wait to see how it will all pan out in the full release.\\n\\nBut, there are a few cons to this early access version. The menu options are a bit limited, making it hard to navigate and find what you\\'re looking for. And sometimes, the character\\'s dialogue feels a little dry and under-seasoned. But these minor issues aside, I\\'m definitely looking forward to getting my beak into the full release of this game.\\n\\nIn conclusion, \"Definitely Not Fried Chicken\" is shaping up to be a tasty and enjoyable game that\\'s worth a try.

First allow products in vehicles be taken out or don't let that product be dropped off at hotlines if it's the wrong item. Second, have a queue waiting times for hotlines instead of the drivers taken ridiculous routes to get back to the destination. Third, allow us to move product off of storage shelves without having to loose all the product by picking up the shelf. I have encountered some bugs nothing really game breaking yet, Mainly menu items not going away and staying with the cursor, Also pro tip, specially with cooking food, just because you have an outfit to cook faster at least for now, I wouldn't recommend using them because the workers constantly drop items making them contaminated.\",\n",

That means that the total number of workers will not decrease, leaving the player with an even smaller availability of workers.\\n- deleting a shift schedule results sometimes in not being able to reassign workers at a different one or fire them. the game will automatically set them with a $700 a day salary and they will not do any task\\n- workers of the drug factory will not work after you reassign them to another task\\n\\nalso please add the possibility for workers of the drug factory to sleep. They are always tired and drop the products on the floor to go to sleep.\\nAlso the feature to name and reorder the list of employees will be a nice feature, maybe adding a small preview of how they look and what clothes they are wearing could be a nice idea to make the game more intuitive.\\nadd the possibility for the cars to automatically collect the product required for deliveries and stop giving away what for free what the deliver doesn’t ask for or what has already been satisfied\\n\\nI’m sorry for my bad english, I know the developers will do wonders with this game!\\n',\n",

So don't expect shootouts and gang warfare fighting over turf. A very high percentage of the game is locked(check the road map). With 2 million dollars and the game just making endless money i've now lost interest. you have nothing to spend your money on so even with the unlocks of bigger business later on, i see no point. Give us mansions an avatar to customize and an entourage or something(think Scarface the ps2 game). i just feel like a tycoon not a drug lord.

Not worth the price AT THE MOMENT.\\n\\nReview: After spending a decent amount of time in this game, in it\\'s current state I can\\'t recommend buying it. Too much needs to be done.\\nIssues: \\n* Character AI is terrible. Nothing worse than people you are paying to do a job standing around. (They are fixing this as a priority)\\n* Monuments do not work (known issue, added to the list)\\n* \"upgraded\" equipment does not offer any additional benefit (known issue)\\n* Delivery path finding needs work. Time sensitive deliveries and my drivers are doing circles around the block.\\n* two \"employees\" per purchase of production land is just not enough, needs re-balancing / increasing or have security personnel as it\\'s own capacity and separated from workers.\\n\\nTechnical issues:\\n* Poorly optimised. Once your empire is \"big\" then game performance just tanks.\\n* After a relatively decent amount of playtime it chews through my RAM, using in excess of 10GB\\n* Random crashes, usually jumping from owned properties/fronts via the menu icon. (Save often)\\n* UI elements just stop working and are unresponsive randomly. Character equipment sheet and interacting with placeable objects mainly.\\n\\nAll this is known to the devs and I\\'m sure there are other issues I just have not raised.\\n\\nNote to devs: Please change the default settings for any object that can be \"filtered\" for accepted items to nothing (default is set to accept EVERYTHING) upon placement rather it would be better to let me filter manually after placement. examples include: Storage shelves, delivery vehicles, processing equipment.  There is nothing more annoying than trying to add storage/delivery route for meth (or other products) and your workers charge in with hands full of everything else and start throwing it on a shelf. This is a QoL improvement that in my opinion is just needed.\\n\\nOverall, when this game has had some more work and optimisation done to it, it will be a very chill, fun game. I will revisit this in the future and if they fix the issues I will change my recommendation but for now I cannot recommend it. Give it time.\\n\\nEdit: grammatical and conciseness changes.',\n",

Inside, you can be thinking about your homework, or friends, or your side business, but no one should ever know it. Because at Los Pollos Hermanos, someone... Is always watching.

       "  'review': 'For me this is a definite reccomend!\\n\\n“you know that watermelon in Japan they grow by putting them in a box? Well, they did that but with people” - Dev\\n\\nAll my game time so far has been on the steam deck, so first of all, the games aesthetic is fitting and well done, it has that 80’s vibe as advertised. I’m not sure where the dev is from, but back in the 80’s we used to have these coffee/hot chocolate machines that look exactly like one of the drink machines in DNFC. I keep one in my drug factory kitchen, makes me smile every time I see it, reminds me of those sweet molten hot-hot chocolates at a hockey game/practice.\\n\\nAnother thing I really enjoy is the almost perfect balance of micromanagement and idler type of gameplay, there is just the right amount of mix, the drug making randos  require little input in to what they do, and more emphasis is placed on fine tuning your operations to find the right schedules, planning workflow, etc to get the most efficient operation as possible.\\n\\nHowever one thing I find the game lacks, for me anyway, would be an optional “refinement method”. For instance with weed, I think something like adding curing as an optional process, having a curing station which would take additional time at a slower progress rate. Jar up the weed, let it sit for some time and add a “Top Shelf” quality level, or even a nutrient mix station which depending on your nutrient mix could make the plant grow mutant huge, crazy fast, double harvest amount. \\n\\nOne major flaw I find at this point in the game would be I find the UI a tad clunky and unintuitive, but this is EA and I’m sure there are QOL and UI refinements in the future so this really isn’t a dealbreaker in my books. My other gripes are largely related to a few bugs, but again, not a dealbreaker for me.\\n\\nOne bug I found that made me giggle for hours was when one of my gardeners glitched up and he had a watering can stuck in his hand constantly spraying water, spraying water in bed, spraying water as he was being sprayed by water in the shower, eating meals, it was hilarious, everywhere this man went, he was spraying water, some say he still sprays water constantly to this day!\\n\\nThe game has only crashed on me once so far, and it was a really hard crash, frame rate plummeted and locked up my steam deck, so I had to get out of my lazy-boy to reset my Gaben deck, and this made me angry, until it didn’t.\\n\\nI’m really hoping there will be more music added, while I like the music, I need a bit more variety.\\n\\nOverall I really enjoy the game, yea the asking price as the game sits is a bit steep, but as a fan of tycoon games, I’ve spent more for less for sure. I like the fact the people in the game are grown in boxes on the ground in Japan like the watermelons, the game has some deep lore.\\n\\nSo easy buy for me, I hope the dev keeps going strong, as I’m excited to watch this game grow!',\n",

       "  'review': 'Good game now with a big potential and lots of rough edges in it\\'s current state. Now I have only played 2 hours so far but I can get an idea about a game from that. It\\'s more indepth and engaging than I thought it would be. The \"clucky\" graphics you barely even notice after 15 minutes.  Some things that need work. It would be fun if you could name your toons. Maybe you can but I didn\\'t notice if you could. The toons don\\'t seem to upgrade their skills. Which seems an obvious thing to do but maybe I didn\\'t get far enough into the game yet? The tutorial is crap. To be honest, the things it explained well I could either figure out for myself or knew from other games. Or the things I didn\\'t, often the tutorial more confused me than helped me.  It can be confusing to figure out what the hell they are saying to do. Several times I did what I thought was right but the tutorial wouldn\\'t forward until I \"randomly\" tried other things. If you do something in the tutorial before it asks you to do it, you have to undo that thing and redo it for the tutorial to register that you did it. Several times when it did forward, I got a black screen with a movable cursor that made me have to start over again. And one time the tutorial just would not forward to the next part no matter what I did. And I clicked on every possible thing I could have. I just got a arrow point to something to click on and when I clicked on that button a new screen came up with another arrow. I click on that button and it takes me back to the first screen. Rinse and repeat. But none of these things seem to happen in the actual game. And I just skipped by the tutorial after awhile and was pretty much fine.\\n\\nSome BIG annoying things in game is 1. you build these rooms with nice thick walls. But the toons don\\'t respect the walls at all. They more often than not walk right through them. And when they don\\'t walk through them they don\\'t always take the quickest way to where they need to go. 2. If you build a room and decide to expand it later, the ground dosn\\'t seem to expand with the room. In other words, what passes as dirt in the game stays as dirt for the floor and one room seems to have kept the original walls from the first build of the room but they don\\'t affect the toon going to the new area. 3. When you first start the game, the main bad guy just sends a few of his overpowered troops to your place and wipes out everybody and everything. Now you have to rehire and get an engineer to fix everything. Why? It looks cute but more annoying than cute. 4. I really don\\'t like having to hold the scroll wheel as you move the mouse to move around the screen and the right button to turn. It seems to me that should be reversed if anything. Having basically skipped most of the tutorial, or maybe I really didn\\'t because there is no hint at all that there was much more to it than I saw, I found myself unable to figure out how to upgrade the quality of my products. I.E. make better pot. It clearly says you can and I know putting lights in helps do this but they don\\'t seem to be doing it so far. The first crop or two is high quality but after that it\\'s all trash. Even with the lights. It says certain things affect the quality but it really dosn\\'t say what things you need to use to affect what or what the crop needs to be better quality. How does buying a \"front\" business help me? I know why in real life but not in game. And a few other things. Also, there seems to be some sort of point system that when you get enough points it unlocks more items to use. I have no idea how that works but I seem to be getting points some how. Hey, it\\'s a pre release, these things are to be expected.\\n\\nHaving said all that, the game is a lot of fun and most of the things I complained about are minor easily fixable things you expect in a pre release. Would I buy it again now knowing this? Sure. It\\'s playable and fun and it seems addictive. Given more time I can find the answers I need or figure them out myself.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Edit Post Major Patch 1: Still rough, but getting better. Fewer bugs overall, but it felt like I needed to restart the game more to get rid of some little issue than I remember. New content, but I didn't have the time to put in to get through the early game to try it. The time speed in this game seems a bit slow, and doing most things takes significant time and investment with often small margins for error. I would like to see some sort of a planning mode that works with the overlays, or at least the ability to sell purchased equipment within a short timeframe for the same price it's bough for, because figuring out ideal layouts can be tricky and take some trial and error. It sucks to have to eat the cost because the game doesn't give you a way to work it out without spending money.\\n\\nOverall, still the same sentiment: I currently would only recommend this to people who really enjoy management style games who are willing to support an unfinished game that shows potential.\\n\\nOriginal Review\\n\\nVery Early Access, but a very good concept and it could be a great end product. I plan to update this review as the game develops. For now it is a recommend with caveats.\\n\\nIt's buggy right now and a large chunk of planned content isn't implemented yet, so don't buy if you're looking for a polished experience. That said, the bones of a good game are here, and I'm excited to see how this game evolves. I was excited to restart as I learned ways to make my operation more profitable or efficient, and the systems are engaging and complex enough that every run felt (and ended) different. \\n\\nLogistics plays a large role in everything on both a micro and macro scale. The distance between your workstations, the lengths of your hallways, and even the path your trucks must take to reach other destinations is something you'll want to keep in mind. I find that challenge stimulating, though I would like to see some further development. The ability to set task priorities for workers, box and ship intermediate production items (like uncooked donuts, for example), and the ability to set custom routes for transports would be great. To go from great to incredible would be implementing rotating availability of a larger number of purchasable properties and logistic hubs like warehouses or garages to allow for more complex supply chains.\\n\\nThis game has plenty of positives, but I currently would only recommend this to people who really enjoy management style games who are willing to support an unfinished game that shows potential. Some of the bugs currently being worked on should have been found with just regular play testing before release, there were some choices that felt like they were the result of a rushed release, and this game is too new to know for sure how the devs will progress, but I'm rooting for this game and I think it could be great.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]EDIT: Updated Review at the Bottom[/h1]\\n\\nSo far, this game is a pretty good example of \"EA\" that people complain about the most.  I\\'ve been following this game for a year or 2 and was excited to see it finally out.  I normally don\\'t have a problem with EA games and still can find some fun in them, but this game makes it hard to.\\n\\nFirst off, it\\'s the same ol\\' tale that you are seeing on reviews for this game: Tutorial sucks.  It really sucks.  It has you do the bare minimum and then just...stops.  I can\\'t really say it just \"stops.\"  More like that common movie trope where the dying old man is about you tell you the biggest secret in the whole universe but just gasps and dies.  Like Yoda, about to tell Luke about Vader, but just disappears into thin air.  Yeah, that\\'s how this tutorial works out. \\n\\n\\nLike others have said, Time is slow and I wish they fully explained it so I will.  Unlike games like the Sims, Two Point series, Planet Coaster/Zoo, when you hit the fast forward buttons, time moves very fast.  This game\\'s option is normal, normalish, normallishish. See, you need to make deliveries to get paid, but the city is rather large and it takes quite a while to make a delivery.  Not to mention, each delivery requires 7 drop offs to get paid (which, btw, the tutorial never talks about). Clicking on the fastest option doesn\\'t really help a thing.  I\\'m not asking to skip an entire day but can we have a sense of urgency?\\n\\nThen there are several upgrades and items that have literal \"EA\" on them. I mean, that is expected in an Early Access title.\\n\\n\\nIf for some reason you still want to get this game I have to tell you, be prepared to start a new game a few times until you can figure this mess out.  However, and this drives me crazy, if you need to start a new game, the only option you have is to exit out of the whole game, open the game up again in Steam and then choose a new game. There is no way to \"Exit to Main Menu.\"  I don\\'t understand how basic menu features are none existent in this game that allows you to have multiple saves.  \\n\\nI love management games and this one is unique and right up my alley.  However, they decided to be a little too unique with their strange design choices, that I can\\'t recommend this game AS IS.  I can see this game being better in 6 months and even \"Great\" by the time it leaves Early Access.  Devs have already been acknowledging a lot of the bugs and hopefully some QOL.  As for now, wait a bit.\\n\\n[h1]UPDATED REVIEW:[/h1] \\n\\nSo, I\\'ve added several hours to this game but don\\'t let that you fool you.  In order to get a good chunk of money going, I highly recommend letting the game run as you go do chores/work/errands and etc.  With more money in the bank you\\'ll be able to explore more about the game.  In doing so, I have found out more things I dislike about this game:\\n\\nThings that have AOE (Area of Effect) are pretty trash in this game right now.  There are certain conditions that need to be met in order to grow a high quality drug such as temperature and light.  You have basic UV lights, heaters, AC and etc.  You can also get upgrade these things like Over Head Grow lights or Large Heaters but they pretty much suck/useless.  You\\'d think you\\'d be able to put overhead lights, well, overhead your plants.  You can\\'t.  You figure that putting a Large Heater, right in front of your product would be sufficient enough.  Wrong.  You put it at a specific angle that doesn\\'t make any sense.  \\n\\nEmployees at your restaurants are constantly dropping things.  I\\'ve seen 3 year olds with iron like grips compared to these but wholes. I\\'ve once watched an employee pick up and drop the same burger 4 times in a row, leave it, then eventually come back before dropping it 2 more times. The worst part is, when they drop the food it becomes contaminated and will make customers sick who will eventually die (luckily there is no penalty for this...yet).  There is no way to get rid of the contaminated food.  You can\\'t even put a garbage can in the kitchen for these but wholes to just throw it away.  \\n\\nEmployees also seem to have a mind of their own and will outright refuse to do tasks that YOU have told them to do.  For some reason, my employees really hate making glazed donuts, even though they are tasked to do it, and the glazed donuts have their very own station and dedicated fryer and they refuse to make it.  You can fire employees but  I really hope they eventually add in the ability to just kill off these useless employees.\\n\\nWho also thought it was a great idea to make the burger fryer a special but-whole unit that must have a heater next to it or else it will explode?  If you do not maintain this thing with a heater (awkwardly placed, taking up valuable space) and maintenance man, it will explode and set your whole kitchen on fire.  \\n\\nGame crashes at the weirdest times too.  \"Oh, whats that?  You wanted to check on your employee\\'s condition?\" Crash. \"Oh, you like saving because I\\'m in EA?\" Crash. \"Oh, that youtube video you were watching went into a commercial break?\" Crash! (This literally happened last night to me).\\n\\nThis is really tough for me.  I really do see the potential of this game and it\\'s going to be fun, when it\\'s fixed up, but it\\'s current state is making me start to hate it.  I\\'m still sticking with my original review that this game is a big NO.  I\\'ll keep testing this product, for you and the devs, and will update when its working.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game has some work needed, but overall I think it\\'s pretty good.  \\n\\nFor the devs: the biggest problem I have with it at this point is that it needs a better system for distributing your wares.  The mopeds and cars are a great idea, but the problem is that it\\'s pretty tedious and difficult to see at a glance what is happening logistically.  \\n\\nAs an example, you get calls in the neighborhood requesting your goods.  You have to assign vehicles you own to take the goods to the location.  This is fine at first, but it quickly becomes obvious that there will be a lot of these requests and you\\'ll have to be going into the dispatch screen to just tell your cars to go to a bunch of places.  I think this detracts from the game a good bit.\\n\\nAlso, there\\'s not really a good way to distribute goods efficiently to the other businesses you own.  Cars get sent to locations regardless of how full the local storage is, meaning they could just be sitting overnight (since inventory is static at night) and only keep doing the rounds late in the morning.  Distribution could be automatic--stores request goods they want--or you could make a new job \"the dispatcher\" to handle those logistics.  Either way, the logistics are not great.\\n\\nI think the limit on factory workers based on plots owned doesn\\'t make a lot of sense and it\\'s a little unbalanced.  At the current setting, I don\\'t see a way to defend my factory and still produce.  Maybe this was intentional since attacks don\\'t yet seem to be a thing.\\n\\nStill some buggy things but overall, very nice little game.',\n",

So if you are on the fence let me say two things. \\n1) The game is missing a ton of content and nothing like the videos they post to sell this game. The videos also show items that are not in the EA which is deceptive to those buying.\\n2) The game will randomly die and crash at any moment. People complain about crashing. This has never happened to me. But the AI will bug out randomly. \\n\\nPROs\\n-------- \\n-- The Idea is great if done correct\\n-- I like the look of the game\\n-- Alot of potential\\n\\nCONS\\n--------\\n-- Tons of problems. Cleaners get stuck alot. The AI has so many issues that its hard to believe the game was released. The people playing this EA failed the programmers badly.\\n-- Only thing you can make is 3 Pots and cloudy Meth. Everything else is missing.\\n-- Only stores you can make is Laundry mat and doughnut store. Not sure if Chicken Shop is possible. Doughnut store is extremely buggy.\\n-- After 30 hours you seem to make more money making 3star cheap pot. Not much depth.\\n--- Way too many CONS to post.\\n\\nOne game I got attacked by the Mayor. Next game I created 4 guards and no attacks after 10 hours of play.\\nOVERALL - Tons of problems and tons of missing content. But maybe worth the wait. So far I find myself playing a ton just to see how fast I can make cash. For some reason this has gotten entertaining and addictive. \\n\\nADDED: Since Tom Merge responded and will hopefully read this. You should be embarrassed at the buggy mess the game was released in.

It has almost everything you would expect in a game of the genre. \\n\\n With that being said there is definitely room for improvement, first and foremost the tutorial pretty much taught me nothing about the game. A better tutorial would help out a lot. There are also quite a few bugs (to be expected) that you have to work around with the current state of the game. The point system to unlock new stuff doesn't seem to work entirely and makes progressing through the game harder and frustrating. The Devs have created a great building block with the early access release and I hope to see them build on that. This price should be a little lower on the game at the moment in my opinion, but if you can get it on sale it is for sure worth it.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you\\'re watching this tape, I\\'m probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn\\'t want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn\\'t know where to turn.\\nEventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I\\'m a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can\\'t take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is\\n\\nJokes aside, Really good game, I\\'m really excited for future Updates!',\n",

       "  'review': \"I think this could easily be another triple A game but the Mechanics need work.\\n-It's extremely slow. Seems like it takes real time 30 minutes to make a delivery. Not sure if that's true or not but it doesn't matter either way.\\n-The delivery system aside, the speed up button is extremely slow. 3x speed makes the game run slow and thats max speed. The minimum speed needs to be 6x what it is with a 1000% increase per speed up.\\n-this isn't a good project time game. Don't plan on spending a weekend playing, you will be watching TV and playing on your phone so much you will forget it's in the back ground.\\n-the vehicles suck. making basic deliveries to a persons house takes 4 mopeds minimum and later 2 cars. It's complete crap, I can't imagine rolling up to a standard house with 2 cars full of dope or 8 mopeds. 1 car, 1 house, 1 moped, 1 house, it should only require more if you are delivering on an industrial level in which case you should be making 20-30 thousand per delivery. 8 mopeds and 2 cars worth of dope to make 1.000 is ridiculous and not worth the time of playing.\\n-There's no explanation how to make the drugs grow. only the Dev can play this game.\\n          I can easily see this being a really good game with sandbox options or mods. Alternatively if the complains are ignored it will flop being an idle game at best.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[b] Target Audience: [/b]  Very Patient Players......Very Patient. [I] [/i]\\n\\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \\n\\nI admit, this one drove me up the wall. Look, I get that games may be a little rough in early access, and I try to keep an open mind when it comes to the gameplay to give updates. I know that a simulation genre is also one that it's a little bit tricky to do in early access: with multiple mechanics to refine and to mess with. But the first impression that Definitely Not Fried Chicken made with me was bad: and seem to frustrate me at every turn. Whether it being missing elements to snap back to our main area, confusing icons, or just not giving enough of a tutorial on certain things, all I could think was about other games like it that wouldn't be frustrating me as much as this one was.\\n\\nI mean look, if your employees literally are at 0 food or hygiene, and you can't specifically tell them to do that task, I expect the AI to be like “oh, I'm going to die. I probably should deal with this.” Instead, they went and watched TV. Like that's the kind of things that frustrated me through the game, whether it be apparently being able to build over my area with a road that I definitely didn't want, or having items take up way too much space on the playable area (why do I need two spaces for a wall dryer?!?). Frustrating controls aside: you don't even really get into the front part of the game until a bit later, and a rea at that point, you're just wanting to stab yourself to remove yourself from the experience.\\n\\nLike, maybe it'll build into a game worth something down the road. But right now, I have no confidence in the base product because there's so many problems left and right. \\n\\n\\n[b]Stream Footage:    [/b]  https://youtu.be/aIaRlLtjpgY\\n\\n\\n[u] Lists: [/u]\\n[b]Positives:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] A bit of mechanics. \\n[*] Some ok visuals. \\n [/list]\\n\\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] The pace of the mechanics is so fast and so many, that you can't keep track of everything when the game lets go and you get confused.\\n[*] The game's tutorial teaches you some mechanics....but not others. And then sorta makes you try to figure out things on the way.\\n[*] UI at times is frustrating to get through and keybinds for things you'd figure that you'd want (go to the base of your operation for example) aren't here.\\n[*] The game feels overly complex in certain areas (the schedule for example) that maybe should have waited to be introduced down the road.\\n[*] The worker AI will literally let itself be killed even if you literally try to tell it “hey, take the time you need, get yourself well.” It will ignore things like a shower and will watch TV instead if that one is semi-low, oh by the way YOU DIED DURING THAT TIME.\\n[*] Glitches like values staying on your mouse or people going through walls are common. \\n[*] The game takes a LONG time to load the first time around....on a machine that can games with 25x complexity in an instant. \\n[*] Just frustrating.\\n [/list]\\n\\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

They game-play mechanics are solid, but there are a lot of bugs like product being dropped and never picked up, AoE adjusters freezing, and no longer being adjustable until I reload the game.\\n\\nAlso things like heaters seem to be broken/bugged, because as far as I can tell there is zero difference between a small and large heater (or any other AoE item for that matter). and THEY COST WAY TOO FREAKING MUCH TO OPERATE! Like seriously I can't figure out a way to get a return on your investment with those things.\\n\\nTLDR This game really has the potential to be a fantastic tycoon style game, and probably will be someday.

       "  'review': \"READ WHOLE THING PLEASE\\n\\nOkay so yes I'm giving it a thumbs up. But the game isn't perfect and it's definitely got problems. I'm only giving it a thumbs up because there's no middle ground neutral button and I don't think it deserves a thumbs down.\\n\\nTechnically the game does what it sets out to do. It's a simulator game about drug peddling. The management is decent, the gameplay is sufficient and the loop is kinda fun and addictive. So because it does those fairly well it gets a thumbs up.\\n\\nHOWEVER\\n\\nThe game is broken to the point it almost crashed my PC half a dozen times. No i'm not exaggerating. During it's loading screen it freezes at minimal twice per loading screen and almost crashes every time.\\n\\nThen you've got certain functions simply not working. Game asked me to place a break room. I tried but nothing happened but the game still thought that it was built so it wanted me to continue doing the tutorial, only I couldn't. \\n\\nSo the game is still very unstable and honestly every time I try to open up the game I get nervous that it's going to destroy my PC.\\n\\nPlus the game is very unfinished, missing a lot of content which I suppose makes sense because it's early access but still I thought I should say so.\\n\\nAnd then you've got some functions of the gameplay that are downright poorly designed and need to be adjusted. Like the delivering of your goods to yoru customers. They take one box at a time, it's super slow and half the time you'll find yourself just staring at your screen for 5-10 minutes just waiting for orders to be completed while you're depleting money the whole time. The delivery needs to be sped up somehow or something I don't know but it needs to be more engaging then that.\\n\\nAlso I don't think that the pricetag is appropriate for this kind of game. Pixelated graphics. No voice acting. Generic sound effects. Repetetive gameplay loop.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a bad game, but I still think that the price tag is a bit too much for an investment. They are making us pay them to playtest their game and I think it's too much.\\n\\nIf you'd like a more in depth look at the game with more information then please check out the video I posted on my YouTube Channel. (Link Below).\\n\\nOtherwise thanks a bunch for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9A12vZnwhI\",\n",

Despite a few minor bugs I've come across, I am really excited that this game is now on early access. It is way too much fun managing your drug manufacturing on top of managing your day-to-day store fronts to push your product. As long as the developers keep up with what they have been doing during development, I think this game can be huge. I spent $20 on the pre-EA build and don't know how much it's selling for on early access, but the $20 I spent feels completely worth it in my opinion. This isn't the most in depth review ever, but I just wanted to give my love for this game and it's devs and also congrats to the developers for reaching early access!\",\n",

It is a musou game, but there is enough variety in the attacks and strategy available to you to allow for really interesting combos and the like. On highest difficulty you'll need to at least try to understand your combo charts, buffs, and act around the actions of your servant. \\n\\nTechnically there are very few issues, only three visual issues I've noticed\\n-Sometimes shadows dont draw correctly immediately, especially from afar\\n-for whatever reason when you walk or have Iori doing a pretty small or slow animation, there is a slight amount of jittering, most noticeable if you walk through town \\n-Link attack popup animations are very low res and gross to look at at 1440p at least\\n\\nAside from those small things though the game looks, controls, and sounds fantastic. Sure you're beating up the same people over and over again, but there is enough to interrupt the mindless slashing with quick thinking and strategy at least on highest difficulty. Boss fights actually have mechanics and some thought that goes into them, although there are some prevailing strats. Leyline battles are simple but fun enough time trial attacks where you get rewarded based on the speed of your clear. That really all I can say. Game is fun :)\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Very surprising game, there's a lot of systems to keep the combat interesting with a bunch of different servants to use. The story so far has been pretty great so far with the exception of there being too many instances of people just escaping from you. The textures of the world aren't the best but overall id say the game looks pretty good. Music is a bop with a ton of different tracks. Overall I definitely recommend this if you are a Fate fan, lots of little nods to FGO fans aswell. Its probably the best actual Fate game released so far.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Writing this review right after completing the game and stepping into NG+, so don\\'t give me that shit about \"damn didn\\'t clear the game and already hating on it\".\\n\\nI didn\\'t even know they could make musou game that would genuinely be bad, as the genre itself is not really know for being complex when it comes to mechanics, but holy shit, this game is BAD. \\nHow could they fuck up such a premise when there are two EXTELLA games that exist? All you had to do is to give us a musou game with servants. In the meantime you see comments like \"MOMMY MUSASHI\" and \"JALTER MY BELOVED\", but you are playing Musashi for a total of 15 minutes, and then JAlter you play for like 15 seconds, only for A SINGLE SECTION they let you control Jeanne. This is fucked up. Actually, no, this is beyond fucked up. I don\\'t even care if that spoils the game to someone because I bought this game for the premise of playing as JAlter because I thought they\\'ll give you like a Free Mode type thing where you can replay encounters with anyone you want, BUT NO, THERE IS NO SUCH THING. Don\\'t be lured in by all the positive feedback. Maybe they\\'ll give you more servant gameplay through season pass, but have you seen the price for that shit?! Doubt it\\'ll be worth it. And if that means that you\\'re playing more Iori, then double no from me. Game does look amazing, and I love the artstyle of it, but goddamn am I just empty after clearing it.\\nAlso, three billion tutorials.\\n\\nYour main gameplay loop is playing the weakest musou character they could come up with, Iori. Why is he the weakest? Well cause everyone gets hyper armor whenever you are fighting as him. The only way to actually deal damage to anyone larger than you is to break their armor by countering or just waiting till their move is done and then time your strikes while their defence is \"lowered\". You wanna have fun and play a cool character, which is basically like any servant in the game? We got you. Here\\'s a bar that lasts ~20 seconds that you have to grind for 30 years as Iori, and then maybe by divine intervention you can play a servant until you\\'ve just barely familiarized yourself with their movesets. People who played through the game will tell me \"BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU PLAY SERVANTS ONLY\" and yeah, sure, that would be an argument if you could play them for more than 15 minutes of in-game time. But alas, this is not what Fate game is about I guess. Totally not. Don\\'t be fooled, you\\'re not playing servants in this game for the most part. Even NG+ is just that, it\\'s same game but with your progress already being there. I\\'m disappointed beyond belief. I pre-ordered it because I dreamed of a musou game with servants, given Extella was the only thing closest to that, so I had hopes when I saw Koei making a Fate game. Beaten it because that\\'s the only way I can justify spending money on this piece of shit. And even then it just left me with a bigger feeling of disappointment. Cause the whole time I played, I was hoping that the game will allow me to just pick servants I wanna play as and ditch the stupid and weak Iori. I just wanted a musou game with servants that\\'s not riddled with stupid tile-conquering gameplay shtick and I couldn\\'t even get that, unbelievable. \\nDo not buy this. Just don\\'t. Maybe on sale 10 years later along with whatever content comes out for it later, but not full price. This is a huge flop and I hope that whoever is writing those positive reviews will wake up and see the game for what it is.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Pros:\\n- This game takes Fate back to its roots. You have a roster of very cool and mysterious servants who all of their true names hidden. The masters are interesting and the dynamic between master-servant pairs is actually relevant again.\\n- Character designs have returned to that grounded Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero style. This game is a breath of fresh air from the overly \"Tropey and Anime\" designs that FGO and Fate/Apocrypha started to introduce.\\n- The cutscenes are fantastic. I feel like I\\'m watching Unlimited Blade Works again for the first time when a fight scene is being shown.\\n- Character progression is easy to understand and meaningful. The moves you learn are flashy and fun to use. Changing stances actually changes the way you play\\n- Enemy designs are either completely new or taken from FGO and given a nice makeover. If you remember the little Onis from Shimousa or the Kintoki rider event, those make an appearance and they actually look creepy.\\n- There\\'s a saint quartz joke.\\n- Grail Front inspired combat makes it in the game with a fresh coat of paint and is very fun.\\n- You get paid to pet dogs and cats.\\n- Noble Phantasms look pretty badass.\\n- Voice acting is pretty great.\\n    - Gilgamesh\\n\\nCons:\\n- This style of JRPG isn\\'t for everyone. It plays similar to Extella or Hyrule Heroes in the sense that its designed kind of like a hoard hack and slash. It\\'s redeemed by the fact that major targets/bosses have cool moves and are fun to fight against. I was hesitant my money was well spent at first but the gameplay improved.\\n- Your servant is another saberface, which is a minor critique at best. Her character design is changed enough that she definitely looks unique.\\n- If you aren\\'t on controller you\\'re gonna need to do some serious work on key-bind remapping to make the game feel good. Once you find your sweet spot though it plays pretty good.\\n- That\\'s it. Those are all my problems with the game.',\n",

Before going into this game understand YOU PLAY THIS GAME AS A SINGLE DUDE AND THE SERVANT SECTION IS A POWER UP MID FIGHT.\\n\\nI've seen lot's of upset people you can't swap between numerous servants on the fly for this game's combat and I don't want to mislead people. You play as a single voiced protagonist with a single servant, and later on I imagine you unlock the ability to fight with other servants. Mid fight after raising a special gauge you switch to controlling your servant for a time before swapping back. This is pretty much Fate Warriors but with a lot more stuff to do outside of beating people up. If you like warriors, yay. If you don't like warriors... well you may hate this game or be meh about it.\\n\\nStory I'm barely into it so far but if you've watched one Fate property, you've seen them all. This series quite literally has one plot it constantly reuses but with new masters and servants, and this game is no different. Don't go in expecting an amazingly unique experience unless you have never seen Fate in your life, in which case you can go into this game perfectly fine and will probably find it interesting.\\n\\nAs of how far I am in the game, this is like a 7/10 as someone who likes Fate, and as someone who is FINE with warriors gameplay.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It's just like something out of one of my Japanese animes!\\n\\nThis is the closest they've come to making a playable version of the original Fate/Stay Night VN in spirit. It only took 20 years. Accessible entry point for newcomers that want to see what the franchise is about.\\n\\nThe main warning I'd give is that, like the VN, there is a *lot* of reading. The game really revels in creating a distinct sense of place, and it benefits greatly from this. In much the same way you come to learn the streets of kamurocho in Yakuza, you get similar vibes here, plus the historical aspect which is omnipresent.\\n\\nCombat is solid, and good enough for the fraction of the game it takes up. Would have preferred a full character action style  but the game layers a lot of additional systems on top of the basic musou light and heavy system. Boss fights are genuinely really quite good, and the hard difficulty is punishing, but not crazy hard or anything.\\n\\nGraphics are pleasant enough but not cutting edge by any means. Could probably have been a PS3 game, albeit not with this resolution and framerate. High budget cutscenes are all stellar, and feel like you're watching one of the ufotable shows.\\n\\nInterested to see what they do with DLC, hope they add more content for the other servants as that seems to be one of the larger complaints at present.\\n\\nOh and this game's Saber is also fantastic. Great facial expressions.\",\n",

What if we did that again with surface level changes?\"\\n- The game looks amazing visually\\n\\nThe bad\\n- World feels rather empty.

       "  'review': 'Game in itself is great, BUT.....\\n\\nBeware M+K Players. \\n\\nReasons:\\n\\n- UI/Menuing is horrible with M+K, no mouse functionality here. You can not use Clicks for neither \"Confirm\" nor \"Cancel\"\\n\\n- That in itself is arguably bearable, if not for the fact that the \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" functions are unchangeable set at \"Enter\" and \"Backspace\",... smart control scheme if you intent to play with a Mouse.\\n\\n- Receiving an Item can not be confirmed by a simple click, you are forced to use \"Enter\", because the function can not be set to another key...\\n\\n- \"Lock on\", disables free camera movement, classic Gamepad Control scheme without consideration for M+K players\\n\\n- The game does not recognize additional Mouse Buttons, meaning only left/right Click and the middle button are usable.\\n\\n[b]UPDATE:[/b] Selecting Skills is also very rough. You are supposed to hold LCTRL or F then press V/B/N or Space during Combat with WASD movement. \\nNot to mention V/B/N or Space can not be reassigned to another key for this function. \\n\\n[b] So if you are not ready to swap to a Gamepad, be ready for a rough M+K experience.[/b]\\n\\nThe combat in itself, apart from \"Lock on\" feels okay with M+K, though.\\n\\nDespite liking the game, i will use this negative review to warn interested players about the rough M+K support.\\n\\nI shall change this review , if the game receives a Patch solving these issues. With a 70$ price tag a consumer is allowed to expect better M+K support in the year 2023...\\n\\nDevs could you please fix this for all the players, who prefer to play with M+K ? ',\n",

       "  'review': 'The story takes place in 17th-century Japan during the Keian Uprising. You take the role of of Iori Miyamoto, disciple of the legendary Miyamoto Musashi. Iori earns his living by doing odd jobs, following his code of honour to keep the peace. After a strange mark appears on the back of one of his hands, the young man finds himself unwillingly drawn into the Waxing Moon Ritual. In a desperate situation, Iori manages to summon a Servant and confirm his participation in the Ritual as Master. Saber is summoned...\\n\\nFor a newcomer to the Fate franchise, the beginning is usually difficult. Even though Fate has anime adaptations and one of the longest-running mobile games, it\\'s still difficult to introduce a newcomer to the Fate Series without giving them a link to a 5k page wiki... Nevertheless, it was difficult before Fate/Samurai Remnant. The game gently introduces you to the Fate universe, explaining absolutely everything you need to know to fight effectively in a Holy Grail War. I was surprised at how simply and effectively the game explained what are relatively difficult concepts!\\n\\nAlthough Fate/Samurai Remnant is essentially an action-RPG, it offers a long, detailed and complete story, a quality that lives up to the standards of the Fate franchise. Veteran fans of the franchise will find all the ingredients of a good Type-Moon title here. The story explains every element and rule of a Holy Grail War in detail, ensuring that those unfamiliar with the franchise will be able to follow the story smoothly and easily. Once you\\'ve completed the game, you can start a new game to access an extended storyline, a modified ending and brand new scenes that give you even more information about the lore. A classic Type-Moon.\\n\\nOf course, I can\\'t talk about Fate/Samurai Remnant without mentioning Saber. Ah, Saber... I\\'ve lost count of the number of times my quest told me to go right when Saber was on my left, gazing at a food stall... Probably one of the most endearing characters in the entire Fate series! The bond that develops between Iori and Saber is one of the highlights of the game. Little by little, Iori gets to know and understand Saber. In exchange, Saber will get used to Iori\\'s calm and peaceful character, while trying to understand how Miyamoto Musashi\\'s student sees the world... The other characters won\\'t leave you unmoved either. You\\'ll quickly feel a sense of friendship for the Rogue Servants, while surprising yourself with compassion for the other Master-Servant duo, who all have their own stories to tell. You\\'ll also be given a few lessons in history and mythology to help you understand the \"power\" of the True Names of the Servants!\\n\\nIn terms of Gameplay, it would be a bit reductive to say that this is a simple Musou. While Saber can wipe out weak enemies with a single blow, the bosses are... Much more difficult. If you want to understand why I thought first of a \"inspired\" Souls-like game, just play Iori and turn the difficulty up to the max... The boss stages will be a real challenge! The different styles of Iori\\'s swords prevent repetition in battle and force you to rethink your strategy, as Iori adapts his style to his opponents in order to win. I particularly liked the stark difference in power between Iori and Saber. You feel all the weakness of a simple, brave human and the monstrous power of a true Heroic Spirit! This difference is also felt when Iori confronts a Servant. Without Saber\\'s help, it\\'s hard to imagine Musashi\\'s adopted son winning... Each Servant has their own unique fighting style, so you\\'ll enjoy trying them all!\\n\\nIn conclusion, Fate/Samurai Remnant is an excellent introduction to the Fate Series. Beginners will discover all the basics of the universe while enjoying a story full of twists and turns and terribly engaging characters. As for confirmed fans, I\\'m not taking the slightest risk in saying that you\\'ll find what you\\'re looking for as a Fate series fan in this title! This new Type-Moon x Koei Tecmo game is an unforgettable Fate experience!',\n",

       "  'review': \"FOR ANY NON-FATE FANS WONDERING IF YOU NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FATE TO PLAY THIS:\\nYou don't have to know a single thing about the Fate series to play this game. \\nNot only do they teach you how the war and history of the grail wars go, this is also a new installment in the Fate franchise. Completely tied to nothing else in any way\\n\\nNow for my 7.5hr review:\\nThe beginning of the story is about how any other Fate story would go, but now set in the Edo period of Japan.\\nThe Masters are all very unique. So are the Master's Servants and Rogue Servants\\nThe gameplay has a lot going for it. From little mini-games like honing your blade and woodcarving to core gameplay mechanics having tag team systems and link attacks.\\n\\nMY MAIN DRAWBACK FROM THE GAME:\\nLike the Fate/Extella games, the controls on mouse and keyboard are atrocious. You HAVE to play on controller to have a good experience. I hope one day this is something they actually try to care about rather than it feeling like an afterthought.\\n\\nAs fan of Fate for over a decade i can say this is probably their most dense game yet. Even after 7+ hours im only in the beginning stage of Ch.2 (Still waiting on Fate/Extra Record!!)\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I am a huge Fate/ franchise fan. I was probably going to like this game regardless, so feel free to let that color everything else I have to say.\\n\\nI was immediately apprehensive when it was announced and in the trailer there was the Omega Force logo. Omega Force are excellent developers, but they live in their niche and thrive there. As great as Omega Force are at diversifying the gameplay in their licensed Warriors titles, it\\'s already been done in the franchise with both Extella and Extella Link being musou games. \\n\\nThankfully, they managed to find an excellent balance with what they know and new mechanics. Combos initially flow like those in a musou game, linear chains of light attacks followed with a heavy, but they inject a need to react and play off the opponents that is so often missing from their more typical fare.\\n\\nThey also manage to make the player character feel strong and useful, while demonstrating the huge gulf that exists between Masters and Servants as far as their strength. You don\\'t feel underpowered or useless, but you absolutely do need your Servant to survive. Enemies aren\\'t like those in other Omega Force titles, they can take a beating and if you fail to stay on your toes, they will punish you and easily deplete your HP bar.\\n\\nStrictly viewing this as a Fate/ game, this is the best adaptation of a Holy Grail War in any non-Visual Novel game so far. It perfectly captures the delicate act of having to balance the facade of daily life while also uncovering the other Masters, preparing for nightfall when the veil of secrecy is easier to maintain and all out Servant vs Servant combat can really take place. \\n\\nAs far as the story they do retread some well-worn story beats, borrowing from tropes established in more than a few Fate/ stories. It does make for an excellent introduction to the franchise for first timers though, and a entrenched fan will probably find it nostalgic. [spoiler] I will buy it a second copy on console if any of these idiots say, \"People die when they are killed\". You have my word. [/spoiler]\\n\\nOmega Force and Koei Tecmo as a whole have really out done themselves with this release',\n",

       "  'review': \"This game takes zero risks. The gameplay is yet another Musou game with a band-aid on it in a terrible attempt to pretend it is an action RPG in the Musou engine that has made copy/paste trash but with whatever IP logo on the same game since the early 2000s. Rather than make a real game or take any risks, all these companies pay this company to shit out another turd with a new name and the same copy paste animations and attacks and same terrible AI enemies with rocks for brains that have been there from the first game. The story hits all the same copy/paste of every other Fate series game, insert Saber, can't tell you her name, cute and charming so you like her, protagonist is boring self insert unlikable trash.\\n\\nI will be so happy when the Fate series finally drops the horrible shitty Musou developers and their horrible trash tier combat systems and PS2 style graphics. Get it on sale for $20-30 at most. It's just another trash Musou game with BARELY more mechanics, but a polished turd is still a turd. Musou games are bottom tier effort cheap trash that even mobile phone games out class these days in Gameplay. Save your money and don't encourage them to keep going for cheap cash grabs like this. The day they drop the Musou developers, is the day I start buying every Fate game to release as I'm a huge Fate fan and I want a decent game to buy and play, but they just won't give me one.\\n\\nThis game serves as an excellent litmus test for which review companies or channels are lying to you. If anyone dares give this higher than a 7.0/10 then you know they are the most die hard Fate fan to the point they are hallucinating a good game or they literally never touched a good game before in their life and are only comparing it to the cheapest worst anime knockoff games made. If you want a solid Fate title, sadly, Melty Blood is still the only thing you have. Melty Blood is worth more than the 18th Musou game with the Fate logo slapped on it and the recreation of the same story but with minor tweaks.\\n\\nI want a good Fate game as much as I want a Saber arc anime from Ufotable. Fate is my favorite series and that is all the more why it is so infuriating to see cheap anime fan cash grabs rather than a game that does the series justice. If you are ok buying the 13th Musou game that is absolutely no different from the last 23 they made, by all means, enjoy. But those with half decent taste in games will stay away. Refunded, not worth even half what I paid for it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"tl;dr Worth the wait if you're a musou fan and you don't hate TYPE MOON or a TYPE MOON fan and you don't hate musou games.\\n\\n---------------\\n\\nBased on my initial impressions of the game, I'd say it's more or less following a more open version of the Persona 5 Strikers formula. It's really technically smooth too for me; haven't run into any crashes or anything like that. Some occasional stutter while loading shaders but that goes away the more you play. I have heard about the cutscene skipping bug some people are experiencing; I really hope that Omega Force fixes it, since this game is pretty darn good at first shot.\\n\\nYou got an open world with different zones to walk around and do missions in, you got some navigation that can be done with the help of your servant, dual techs, follow-up strikes, you can temporarily swap to your servant and fight as them for a while, you equip gear, learn spells that use consumables... it's pretty expansive, and has a lot of strong RPG elements that give each character a strong progression curve. The musou combat is on point, though I wish the battles were larger. I hope they get larger later in the game.\\n\\nI've seen some people liken the game to the RGG Studios games as well; walking around town, doing small missions and favors and errands for people, and yeah I would say that's present but not really that oppressive. The point of the game is to ease you into the battles and get you used to these micro-encounters with 25-50 enemies at once, much like Persona 5 Strikers did.\\n\\nI think the main problem with this game though, for most people, is probably going to be that it's pretty niche for what it is; you have to really be a neutral-to-positive fan of both musou games and TYPE MOON, particularly Fate, to really like this. If you are, then this will probably be one of your favorite games to come out this year; and you also probably don't need to be convinced by me to buy it.\\n\\nBut, for the rest of the internet, I think it's probably worth waiting for a sale. This definitely isn't a game that you can use to get into Fate; the story is a mimicry of the core beats of the original Fate/stay Night story, but it won't tell you about anything you'll see in the other big name Fate franchises, instead being more of an isolated story that uses similar themes and ideas. It might be a game you can use to get into the musou genre, but because of its open world and RPG elements, it's very different from the more mission and campaign-based structure of the mainline Dynasty Warriors games, or even the earlier spinoff licensed titles like One Piece: Pirate Warriors, Berserk & The Band Of The Hawk or Hyrule Warriors.\\n\\nThe bottom line is, for fans this is exactly what they want, but for anyone who isn't already in on this type of game or franchise, there's nothing here that will blow your mind or turn you into a fan of either that couldn't be found in one of the games I mentioned earlier in this review. Because of that, while I can easily recommend this to a certain type of person, if you're not really familiar with TYPE MOON or with the musou genre, I would wait for this one to go on sale before you experiment with it.\\n\\nFor the rest of you, you've probably already made up your mind about this game; go download it and play it! It's great.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[quote][h1]Video review: https://youtu.be/iqwEVZNC0w4\\nWritten review below![/h1][/quote]\\n\\nI may like this series and there are some good elements, but honestly, my experience with Fate/Samurai Remnant was just painful.\\n\\n[b]Note: Trimmed to fit Steam, check video for full version![/b]\\n\\n[h2]Combat[/h2]\\nI will start with the good. For one, the core combat mechanics are actually pretty good, great even. You get a handful of stances to swap between and are actually encouraged to do so depending on your HP level, how many enemies you are fighting, and what stats you want to prioritize. It adds a good bit of depth to the otherwise mashfest that is Musou-style gameplay. There is still a bit of mashing, but I liked the extra layers added here.\\n\\n[h2]Gameplay Loop & Difficulty[/h2]\\nIt is just unfortunate that this combat is stuck with some incredibly repetitive and tedious mission design. The game literally opens with you helping a guy collect debts from random people around town. That’s how bad it is.\\n\\nWhen you are not running random errands as main story quests, you are dealing with this absolutely tedious turn-based board game style travel system. You have to travel between nodes to get to your destination and if you run into an enemy along the way, jump into a copy-paste arena to fight them in.\\n\\nAnd the enemies are copy-paste too. You will be fighting the same type of samurai and a handful of monsters the entire game. You occasionally get some new, interesting ones, but it just becomes tiring spamming buttons against the same enemies battle after battle. Especially so given how this game manages its difficulty level: by simply raising enemy HP. Bosses especially, since they get an extra armor meter that just takes forever to break before you actually do damage. It’s not like the bosses are even hard, just boring and time-consuming.\\n\\n[h2]Story[/h2]\\nThe gameplay is only about half of the experience, maybe just 30-40% of it. The rest is visual novel style storytelling, which I honestly don’t mind as a VN fan, but not so when it is as wordy and full of fluff like it is here. For every actual cutscene, you get a full 30 minute dinner dialogue scene. One cool character reveal, and then an info dump where a character explains a simple concept to death as if I was five years old.\\n\\nIt’s just frustrating. Boring and frustrating. I know the Fate franchise is full of lengthy stories, but I don’t recall ever being as bored with them as I was here. The pacing is just far too slow.\\n\\n[h2]Performance / PC Port[/h2]\\nI had no issues playing at 4k 120fps, although it was a bit weird that the game is divided into performance and quality modes on PC, the latter of which listed a 60fps limit. The game still looked fine in performance mode - at least, for this developer’s standard - so I can’t say I minded all that much. There are a bunch of video settings to change too, so props to the devs for that instead of just leaving it as one slider as they have definitely done in the past.\\n\\n[h2]Overall[/h2]\\nI cannot recommend Fate/Samurai Remnant. There are obviously some good ideas here, especially with the combat mechanics, but the gameplay loop, the mission design, and the story full of filler really sour the experience. The Fate/Extella games may have their issues, but they are at least better than this.\\n\\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews + videos!',\n",

       "  'review': \"MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE is a free to play fightering battle royale based on the anime My Hero Academia. The game is okay, it's fun enough. 8 teams of 3 people match, which of course you don't need to stick together. The gameplay is okay and kind of confusing. There's too many buttons to keep track of, you have 6 abilities + items. And when multi  The huge glaring problem I have with the game is the micro-transactions and the multi of in-game currency. Unlocking characters are through a slow level-up or a gacha loot box. I found 2 characters I liked playing, but they are days/weeks of non-stop griding games and I'm losing the will to play anymore playing characters I'm not having fun with anymore. At the end of the day, it's a free to play game, you literally don't lose anything to download and play it. It's fine.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h2] TL;DR It has promise, but in its current state I wouldn\\'t recommend playing this for more than a few hours. [/h2]\\n\\nThe assets [u]heavily[/u] borrow from the My Hero Fighting Game, which are vibrant and fun (especially if you\\'re a fan of the anime) meaning you can pick up one of the hero\\'s / villains you love most in the show and use their iconic abilities. The skeleton/ framework of the game feels to me like a near copy of the Naruto: Shinobi Striker game. So this is a mashup of those two [b] with all of the pro\\'s and con\\'s of both [/b].\\n\\nThe abilities look and feel powerful for most characters, meaning you can hop back and forth between different characters and mess around with play styles. I\\'ve enjoyed the speed based characters the most (Ochaco, Froppy and Ida) as they feel the most unique in using terrain to their advantage. \\n\\nAlthough the abilities look wonderful in the cell shaded style they feel quite heavy and can take up a lot of the screen leading you to easily get yourself lost in a fight with another team. In addition. you\\'ll find that if you\\'ve had your shield broken by two abilities/ attacks that you\\'ll be getting knocked over constantly. The evade window works in a 1v1 setting, but, in this 3v3 game-mode dodging (using Ctrl as default) feels absolutely pointless. \\n\\nMenu-ing is atrocious, honestly some of the worst I\\'ve seen in a multiplayer game, it feels un-intuitive and screens are never as easy to access as you\\'d like. Why can\\'t you unlock characters in the shop, why do some menu icons feel like they need to be clicked twice to access and why is readying up in a small box to the left instead of underneath your character?\\n\\nMonetisation what you can expect from a standard free-to-play gacha game. I\\'ve counted 4 main currencies as well as 3 others that unlock items in the \"gallery\"? Horrible way to pad out timed challenges and battle passes. On top of this, [b] locking characters behind a paywall [/b] will inevitably lead to a toxic Pay2Win environment with some characters being stronger than others, regardless of skill. \\n\\nThe devs have counteracted this by giving new users access to one character ticket to unlock whoever you\\'d like which is a good start, but I doubt it\\'ll help the longevity of the game.  \\n\\n[h3] Here\\'s what I\\'d like to see improved [/h3]\\n- Abilities being on a decent cool down leading to fights needing to rely more on melee and the dodge mechanic\\n- Much simpler menu\\'s \\n- More Game mode\\'s (including solo and team based objectives)\\n- Revive\\'s easier to collect (one ticket rather than three) but are more visible and longer to cast.\\n- Plus Ultra having a kind of Ultimate/ Super attack as at the minute it feels lack luster\\n- Objectives other than box opening and rescuing \\n\\nA Solid 5/10, will keep my eye on it over the coming months.',\n",

       "  'review': 'If you are wondering whether or not this game is worthy of an install read this. The overall game play is very fluid. Your objective is clear and how to accomplish it even clearer. There is a lootbox system to get free cosmetics and if you roll duplicates you get rewarded with another currency to buy MORE cosmetics. The only down side to this game I would have to say is the way you unlock characters Such as Froppy, Bakugo, Todoroki, Mr. Compress and All Might. You have a separate leveling system aside from your account level and License Level(BP). And it takes a very long time just to scrape from Level 0 to 1. Then it becomes a little easier and XP feels as if its coming in larger quantities. But other than that the way the game works, the mechanics, the characters and the cosmetics are 10/10. I suggest installing it if you are a first-timer and try playing about 10 games of UNRANKED. Oh right! There is also a ranked mode for those competitive souls among us! You get to climb through the ranks of Beginner, Amateur, Pro, and Ace. But anyways. Install the game. Get your cosmetics and play about 10 games to really get a feel for it. I recommend it all the way. At the time of writing this I have about 30 hours in the game.',\n",
