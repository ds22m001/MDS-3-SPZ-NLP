      "- as i've mentioned, the game is pretty short - finished it completely (including all achievements) in under 5 hours. on the one hand i fell like i would've liked more, yet on the other hand it was a very concentrated and curated experience. this is the only part where if you are not a fanatic of carlsen's or of puzzle games might want to consider if the price to game to time ratio is enough for you. in my opinion it is very much worth my money.\n",

      "neat mechanics, a little too easy personally, and no where near as good as inside.\n",
      "the game is just boring. it has amazing visual and audio but all this visual and audio does is a short transition from one set of puzzles to another set. and these puzzles are just boring. the are cool boss battles but most of the time you are just running and doing routine puzzles.\n",

      "i tumbled through cocoon in most of an evening and the early hours of the next morning, finishing the game in just under the 6 hour mark, compelled forwards by one of the most intriguing videogame worlds i've explored in a while. before we get started: if i see a single complaint about this game being 'too short for the price', i'm going to explode; cocoon, like few other games, maximises every minute to show you something new, and reminds us what games can be when we take the risk to pursue the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "cocoon reminds me of a number of games: the wide-eyed wonder and revelations of outer wilds, the pick-up-and-put-down trial-and-error puzzling of wind waker's later dungeons, the alien environment of... well, it's hard to pick just one, as cocoon journeys you through the macro and the micro, stretching your mind like taffy to comprehend where and when you might be. without the strong environmental and art design holding it together, you'd get whiplash, but as it stands, worlds which begin novel become familiar over time - which, as it turns out, is key to the gameplay.\n",
      "\n",
      "the puzzling premise, here, is diving in and out of glass orbs, each of which contains a world. to keep it as spoiler-free as possible, you soon discover these glass orbs are the core of your puzzling power, as well as the road your journey takes place on. just as you feel you've discovered the limit of how they can be used, cocoon nudges you a little further, encouraging you to take that mental leap of faith to find a new path forwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "and it really is that - a polite nudge. at no point did i feel like i was headbutting a brick wall in my puzzle-solving. i'm an impatient puzzler, and struggle to get my head around layered puzzles, but cocoon is kind, ensuring i understood the bounds of each puzzle by limiting my area of play, and nearly all frustration is allayed by the feeling that the game wouldn't play tricks on me, or bait me with red herrings. i dislike puzzles of this sort, so if you do, too, you'll hopefully find cocoon is a good balance of puzzle versus progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "there are some brief moments of true frustration, though. for instance, one series of solutions relied heavily on timing, which felt mildly incongruous with the puzzles up until that point. but it wasn't by any means enough to shatter my immersion: and what a world to be immersed in. \n",

      "cocoon is minimalist. a 5-key control system has you absorbed within moments, the need to learn complex key-binds eliminated. cocoon toys with scale, colour, flora and fauna, perspective, shape, so on and so forth, to communicate lore in what is otherwise a wordless, speechless game, and it's at its best for it. \n",

      "while the game is not long at all, clocking around 4 hours for me for 100% completion, i really liked the puzzles, the music and atmosphere. the idea of jumping between worlds is used nicely and doesn't feel bad. the game cleverly reduces the parts of the world you're allowed to travel to so that one doesn't get lost. in several circumstances i was surprised by a new mechanic i didn't expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "i just wish that the game would be a bit longer (like 1-2h) so that some concepts can get more time to shine. even optional (hard) puzzles would be nice.\n",

      "- loved that design-wise, boxes mostly move in their designed lines, but controlling interface makes it feel like you have some directional freedom. this feels amazing and does not brake puzzles by giving players too much freedom. super clever stuff\n",
      "- bosses are too similar to mario bosses and their stages. they clearly provide a good change of pace, but for me they felt weird, mostly because it was not what i expected from the auteur-indie project\n",
      "- worldbuilding and unique setting suggest that the game has something more to tell than a set of abstract puzzles. maybe that happens later, but i have not seen that yet, so felt a bit disengaged\n",

      "\n",
      "my main concerns are the lack of story and the lack of understanding of a bigger picture of where am i in the gameplay progression and what my actions mean, so it felt like i'm solving whatever obstacles the game is throwing at me, for the sake of it. and “it” here is feeling good about the beautiful world, perfect character-camera-controls and magical puzzles. and that's good, i do recommend this game as an exceptionally beautiful abstract puzzle!\n",
      "it might have head and body of \"limbo\" and \"inside\" (jeppe carlsen), but it doesn't have its soul (arnt jensen). it's disingenuous to ride on the hype of the playdead games because \"cocoon\" is nothing to compare with them. there's no story, no emotion. you just do stuff because you can or because it blocks you from doing other stuff without any point or explanation. there's no satisfaction in resolving puzzles. every puzzle had me like: \"oh, it's like this. ok, i guess, whatever\". it's inception-like traversals don't bring anything to the gameplay, but it's just a gimmick which looks \"cool\" in the trailer. i think i'll try \"somerville\" instead despite its negative reviews.\n",
      "the game is visually very appealing, the puzzles are often simple, but yet they require some good thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "cocoon is really well-designed and fun to play, the only thing i think could be better is the playtime. i'm not saying 4h is bad for an indie game, i really really enjoyed and loved it, i think that some mechanics could be developed a little more in depth for that extra “ah-ha!” moment.\n",

      "a well made game that ends right when it got really good. it's a bit too simple for more than the first half, but after that it started becoming much more difficult and then it ended. this wasn't an issue for me for inside because there was a story you could piece together along the way, but this game doesn't really give you any clues as to what you're doing until the very end. that being said, the game still has good visuals/sound design, and the atmosphere is what really holds the whole thing together.\n",
      "absurdly good puzzles that are very complex, but not so far that it is unreasonable. the alien landscape is wonderfully put together as well. there is no dialogue and a very loose story, which is not necessarily a bad thing. in any case, the positives far outweigh any negatives.\n",

      "an enjoyable puzzle game wrapped in a biomechanical skin that looks incredible, and an amazing soundtrack as well. none of the puzzles have been too challenging so far, but some of them do make you stop and think for just a moment, not a frustrating amount of time by any means. lack of tutorial but purposefully so, and introduces new concepts organically.\n",
      "\n",
      "the only real con to the game i notice so far is that it's a short game, but sometimes that's all it takes. i haven't beaten it yet but judging from the reviews of others and the rate i'm gathering achievements, seems to be a 3-5 hr experience.\n",
      "cute chill game\n",
      "this is another game to add to the list of short art experiences that are well worth the price of admission. think artful escape, gris, and of course limbo and inside. annapurna interactive sure knows how to pick who and what to publish because this game deserves all of the love that its getting. \n",
      "\n",
      "there is legitimately not a single part of this game that i can knock. i don't dislike any part of it and thats coming from someone that despises puzzles and puzzle games. the puzzle design and general gameplay felt very good, forcing me to think outside the box a good bit but still very much playing within its own ruleset. \n",
      "\n",
      "the best part of this game though is not the gameplay but the presentation, art direction and music all working in harmony. if you are a little wary that the trailers are just showing the good parts of the game? yeah, those are the boring parts in the trailer, actually. there is a visual feast on display that absolutely blows you away when it gets paired with the atmospheric sound design and a fantastic soundtrack that really does a good job pacing the game out and setting the tone as you move through it. \n",
      "\n",
      "it's hard for a puzzle game to increase in complexity without getting overly complex, but cocoon managed to not only increase the loose narrative stakes throughout the game, but it also gradually increased the complexity of puzzles in an impressive way that kept surprising me. i love how they used the mechanics like building blocks ending with some genuine brain tickling tests that force you to use all of the tools available to you and show that you were in fact not getting lucky up to that point, but understanding exactly how the puzzle mechanics worked. that being said, it was again, very fair and unfrustrating to work through. \n",

      "you can tell a ton of passion went into cocoon, and it really paid off. feels like it came out of nowhere and now it's a strong contender for my goty, right alongside titans like totk and re4. if you're even just a little interested in this game, i very highly recommend you check it out. wonderful experience i won't be forgetting anytime soon.\n",

      "i have always been a huge fan of jeppe carlsen's work. limbo and inside by playdead are both excellent games, but also his lesser known solo work, 140 and thoth are terrific in their own right. if you have played the latter, you might remember my name from one of the achievements. i even had the honor of meeting jeppe carlsen, jakob schmid and some other (ex-)playdead folk and i still cherish the memories of that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "when i heard that carlsen had left playdead to start his own studio, i was sad on one hand, because i had valued his puzzle design of their games as feeling integral to the world. but on the other hand, i felt excited for what was to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "knowing carlsen's work well, i expected this game to put a huge emphasis on game feel and intuitive player guidance with excellent sound design and music integration. and this is pretty much what i got, but i did not, even after watching the trailers, expect this game to look so absolutely gorgeous all of the time on screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "the game controls nice and fluid, everything can be done with eight directions and a single button. if you play on controller, you have analog movement controls but your character's idle animation can only appear in said eight directions. the music is more calm and atmospheric but there are occasional intense sections in the soundtrack, fitting the action on screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "what really boggles my mind is the puzzle design. knowing carlsen, i did not expect any less, but the way in which mechanics are introduced to the player, consecutively in didactically designed challenges to the point where it feels completely natural to come up with the solution for the next puzzle made me speechless. there was never a time in the game where i felt lost or stuck, i always had the drive forward but at the same time, the puzzles always provided the right amount of challenge to me and did not seem trivial to solve.\n",
      "\n",
      "there are very few very, very minor nitpicks that i still feel obliged to state here. the game starts with a \"cold start\" opening which is always cool, but from the player perspective, specifically on pc not always the best, since it prevents players from checking the game’s settings. as a result, the game started, at least for me, in 1080p and 60fps despite my monitor supporting 1440p 144fps and these gorgeous graphics deserve the crispest resolution you can offer them. the other slight issue i found was that some more frequent actions needed a held button press which felt just a tiny tad too long for my taste, to the point where i felt a slight bit of annoyance when i needed to do them often in succession. but as i said, these are absolute minor nitpicks, and the graphics options in the cold start can hopefully be fixed in a future patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "other than that, i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this game. its length and dramaturgical development with environmental storytelling combined with gameplay make for definitely the most compelling experience, by far, i've had with any game i played this year.\n",

      "mind-bending and beautiful.\n",
      "the puzzle/level design here is superb, head-scratching but not bruising. there's an almost nonstop variety of ideas; some conventional, many unlike anything else i've seen in a game before. i'd say it falters only the slightest bit when you're doing the sections that require you to activate symbols in the correct order, but even those aren't carbon copies of each other. immersion has been polished to basically perfection, with zero loading screens after the first boot-up, unintrusive controls, and incredible sounding atmosphere and music. \n",
      "\n",
      "i would've loved a standout challenging final boss after how cool the previous ones were, though i was very satisfied with how the game wrapped up regardless. any game that has excellent artistic merit while refusing to deprive us of creative and interesting gameplay should be praised.\n",
      "wonderful. i love the aesthetic, the soundtrack (incredible sound design btw), and the feeling this game gives you overall. the mix between organic and mechanical is incredibly well made and creative; everything feels so alive, literally. it achieves everything it wants to do, and it does so perfectly.\n",

      "if you liked tunic, you'll most likely enjoy this game as well; they share quite a few similarities. this game has less combat, and has much simpler controls, but when there [i] is [/i] combat it feels polished and is extremely enjoyable. it's relaxing, stressful, creepy, dreadful, and cute all at once. this game deserves so much love.\n",

      "the start seems a bit too simple for me, but it does pick up in complexity. i had hoped, it would be more like a pure puzzle game (somewhat like patrick's parabox maybe), but it's more of an adventure/exploration game with puzzles.\n",
      "what bothers me is that the game won't let you experiment much. after solving a puzzle, you can't interact with the elements anymore, because they straight up dissolve or bridges and gates get closed. it feels a bit too guided for me because of this.\n",
      "i'm not sure if it's too short, or if it's just right in length for what it is. [spoiler]the purple sphere wasn't utilized that much, especially in the end part of the game, which is kind of odd. it probably would have been more satisfying if it was used again[/spoiler]\n",

      "so far, i've acquired 3 orbs (orange, green, and purple) and defeated each of their bosses.  the worlds and puzzle designs are outstanding.  truly phenomenal. i don't know how many orbs there are total... but i'm incredibly excited to find out.  this is easily in the top 3 games i've played this year (out of 100+).  \n",

      "i'm sure i've only scratched the surface so far but puzzle solving in this game is cool in a way that i last saw in can of wormholes, patrick's parabox and baba is you\n",
      "i've been looking forward to this game for so long, after being massive fans of 140 and thoth by jeppe carlsen and jakob schmid. this game is above and beyond what the trailers made me think. every puzzle makes you go \"whoa, i never thought that mechanic could be used in that way.\" the game's visuals are stellar; art style is impeccable. sound design and music are always on point in a schmid game. i cannot recommend this game enough.\n",

      "it is intricate and challenging.\n",
      "absolutely love it.\n",
      "doesn't have me quite as hooked as inside, but it's definitely a good game worth getting if you like platform puzzlers (in this case top down). interesting puzzles, quite imaginative, nothing too tedious so far, always something new. after 1 hours of game play i can definitely recommend it and i'm sure i'll play it through to completion.\n",
      "first\n",
      "awesome game, need to play more but so far wanted to share positive vibes hoping the game does okay in the steam algorithm. amazing puzzles, reminds me a lot of baba is you and patrick's parabox, but definitely more of an emotional experience (audio visual wise) compared to either of those games.\n",

      "good game to pass the time. a suggestion i have would be to add the ability to quick buy or fix your equipment when it breaks, super annoying to have to go into the menu, sell it then buy a new one, which happens very often, maybe also some more extra ways to make money, like a lottery or long quest line with rewards.\n",

      "so i'm going to go into this review just saying that i don't normally play games like this and maybe that's my problem, but i thought this looked really good so i gave it a try. as it is i wouldn't recommend it. definitely not good for beginner players of this genre, doesn't really explain much just kinda drops you in, gives you a few directions, and then lets you have at it. couldn't really figure out what to do, my employees started dying of starvation, my lamps started breaking, and i had no input as to how to fix either. wouldn't let me hire engineers like i thought you would need to do to fix the lights, and wouldn't let me add snack machines which i thought would be what you need to put down to feed your employees. overall looks like there's a lot of good, but needs a good bit of work and definitely a better tutorial for people just getting into this genre of game. hope to be able to come back to the game and see more like that in the future!\n",

      "i absolutely love definitely not fried chicken. the silly animations, the in depth mechanics, i spent a hell of a lot longer making my laundromat the way i wanted it though, while i allowed the factory or grow-house to just do whatever they wanted (i did have to hire a few workers when i did check back at the grow-house because id work em to death). i'm about 7 hours in and i still haven't even made my donut, chicken or seafood restaurant, i love the hard grind but therein lies some problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "with workers, their needs are always deteriorating. but if you don't have em on a scheduled break they just wont do anything. i've set a system for my business with schedule 0,1,2. on 0 they work from 0600 to 1900 but if i see they're unhappy i will switch em over to 1, with is basically break time all day except for 2000 to 23000 when it's time to receive a package from my growhouse, 2 is to send em home. i'm still tinkering with scheduling but that seems to be the best for me yet sometimes it's a bit overwhelming. if i go over to improve the growhouse and forget to open the laundromat then i miss on having passive income that has certainly helped me. why not leave it open then you ask? because my machines need maintenance every single day, so i hire an engineer to come and fix em. cant exactly bring him over when i forget to switch him over to schedule 0. i'd love little reminders or even a \"phone call or text\" from my workers to say \"hey boss are we open today or nah\". any prompt really. i'd also love to have a ranking system for workers. like they can level up and be supervisor, manager etc to give them a bit more responsibility & help your crew in need. why cant the cleaner who just stands around when she's done also accept product? it's not like they dont clean the warehouse where we keep narcotics?\n",
      "\n",
      "also while i'm enjoying the long grind, it seems pretty daunting to unlock everything you need to make more money. 90 pts or 45 packages of good weed or 90 packages of bad weed to unlock a car! now that i've replaced my mopeds with cars, i don't always have enough product to move. the dispatch system also seems kinda broken. if we get so much hands on work, why not allow our dispatchers to deliver certain kind of product to one customer and while having another one highlighted deliver the rest to that one? once you get a hotline, customers will light it up to get you to deliver to them, its only until recently however that i realized i could charge more for a promise of better quality product. \n",
      "\n",
      "and if i'm being completely honest, ive been having a hell of a good time just running my little laundromat. getting all the permits to get the absolute best equipment, maximizing my passive income, while also managing the workers there. i almost forget, oh yeah we're running a drug line here \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "as a shell, this game has the potential to be one of the greatest of all time. so good on the devs for releasing this in ea. while it is almost finished besides adding (ocaine, nightclubs & casinos) the game would be a lot better with some tweaks (no pun intended) here and there. i have a wishlist since jan, so for me this is def worth a buy however buyer be warned that this is an extremely niche title.\n",

      "not yet... cool game, has all the right components but too many bugs... developer is dedicated to fixing them, but some of these issues will ruin your game and make you rage quit a game that should be relaxing.  workers just suddenly stop doing their jobs, equipment catches fire due to that and your entire save file is up in smoke.  no way to save specific points and go back so you literally have to start over or fix the mess.  looking forward to playing it when it has the bug fixed.\n",

      "few games or rather the only management game that i say is well done! and that it's in early access, it's not one of the typical games of this genre that already knowing the mechanics in a short time you give it maximum speed so that time goes by quickly. you have to focus on absolutely everything, employees, warehouses, drugs, orders, their distribution and your business.\n",

      "this game has a lot of potential and i honestly do not regret buying it.\n",
      "love this game, but the game breaking bugs make it unplayable. i've started 2 different campaigns and sunk a ton of hours into each. each campaign has been rendered unplayable due to game breaking bugs. 1st bug made employee list unaccessible when room groups were selected. with 15 workers, the scroll bar for the employee tab is only available when room groups are unselected, but room groups were essential as i had multiple products being produced. 2nd bug was when an attack happened after the mayor got elected. an attacker has been permanently stuck in my factory, so all employees cower as if there's an attack going on, but even when hiring new security they don't know the attacker is there. so the entire factory is shut down and can't operate and there's no way to \"stop the attack\" which the game thinks is active, when its not. i love the whole concept and execution of this game, but i can;t justify sinking hours into growing my business when it will eventually be rendered completely unplayable and i basically have to start a new game. i can never actually grow the business into the massive scale that the game is designed for. fix this crap please!!! i want to be able to play the game!!\n",

      "at this point in development, it is very reminiscent of someone's free-to-play flash-game passion-project. there's a lot there, it's fun, it's creative, but it's jank and very little qol implemented. but there's a lot of potential, and the devs are active in development. \n",
      "\n",
      "speaking to the inevitable early-access jank:\n",
      "after running for 2 or 3 hours it gets glitchy and the ai bugs-out and build-mode gets funky. everything breaks down, but it is still technically playable, just the ai might keep going around in circles or walk around the entire property to use the rear door rather than walk out back. if you enter build-mode and place some rooms, the price will stick on your mouse through gameplay until you go back into build-mode and select then de-select remove room tool. at least, that's the fastest way i've found to fix that. also, when placing room tiles, the flooring textures won't change. you'll have a dirty, earthen floor until you restart the game. then everything fixes itself and the floors appear properly and the ai behaves normally. \n",
      "if any of these things happen, it's definitely worth a restart as the others are not far behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "the qol mechanics are bare-bones. so much is missing from it, as other reviews have pointed-out. transporting your goods via vehicles seems like an okay system at first, but there is very little customization to it, no custom labeling to easily tell one from another, no customizing their loads numerically (you can flag it open to multiple drugs, but how much is added of each is random and up to the ai, which is also randomly performing whatever tasks you've flagged for them), etc. they will depart from your \"factory\" only when full, and will attempt to stop at the chosen destination. if it can't, it'll keep circling the block until there's space. once it reaches its destination it will sit there until others unload it. if you are trying to ship resources to one of your businesses, and the shelf storage for a particular drug is full, the vehicle will sit there indefinitely until space is freed and the last drug is unloaded from the vehicle, or if you manually tell it to return to the factory. that can really fuck with your supply-chain. also, since flagging a vehicle to multiple drugs just lets the ai randomly load things into it (no numerically customization), it's definitely worth buying a separate vehicle and using only a single drugs per vehicle. that gets to be an expensive upkeep, but that's the best system i've found. also, once you have enough drugs to make that especially expensive, you've probably making a whole lot of money, anyway. businesses make a good profit, even without your drugs. the laundromat, not-so-much (it's a laundromat. no expensive dry-cleaning, just the cheap washers and dryers, and the businesses all have a maximum capacity determined by the star-rating. that is another complain of mine. bustling businesses are a myth because of this maximum capacity that is enforced, regardless of accomodations).\n",
      "i'd love to see a blue-print system implemented into the game. construction can get tedious, and i find myself constantly looking back to my older businesses to look at the design i thought worked well so i can copy that over to the new business. cut/copy/paste would also be great. moving a room as a whole, extending a wall, etc. what they got works, but it's missing some qol improvements. looking at this, i've really taken the sims building mode for granted.\n",

      "so, the game itself is super fun. i've beaten up to what is released so far. once you get more than 5-6 products unlocked the game becomes super stuttery, takes several seconds to load when you snap back to your lab. with that said, my replay-ability was decent as i wanted to do it better the next time. once they unlock more with early access ill revisit for sure. but once you start making enough money, there isn't a lot to do. i have almost abandoned drugs at this point and just opened a bunch of restaurants. i'd say its great for about 20 hours of play-ability realistically.\n",

      "its a good game. i feel it does need some major adjustments before it becomes playable though. i feel like doors should only take up the square they swing out to. i think you don't earn enough money from the game, i think the values need to be increased slightly by around 1-5$ per transaction. i think that one major issue is that people don't show up to work on time, if i send people home and their work starts at 8 they shouldn't be rolling in at 9:37 and me still be paying them for an hour of work that didn't happen. i feel like there needs to be more than 6 schedules, maybe 6 schedules for each type of worker. i think that you should also be able to prioritize tasks. ex. this employee will run the register, if no customer's are around he will prep chicken and fries. my biggest pet peeve is that i feel i cannot make a profit unless i am constantly adjusting everything my employees are doing. i feel once i set up my entire shop and get things running it should stay running unless a disaster strikes or i over value something like no time for food. finally, if an employee has nothing to do they should use that time to use the break room and fix their stats. its a really fun and creative game, with extreme potential. disregard this comment if the updates patch these things out.\n",

      "3. time speed at max speed still feels too slow. especially early game this can lead to a lot of just sitting on the phone and waiting for income to be able to do anything at all which is not fun.\n",
      "4. as of right now there is no event i have come across besides the opening one getting attacked by a rival business/former employer and the annoying rocket ship guys who will ask for a delivery and if you say no they will pester you every 3 minutes. please add more asap even just defending the drug warehouse from a couple guys with bats or something.\n",
      "5. maybe a send employees home button for when there are fires as closing the shop only keeps customers out and the employees will mindlessly walk into the flame so either i fire them to send them home, waste a limited schedule space to send them home, or let them burn. please add maybe a fire extinguisher, sprinklers, or a call fire department button maybe? also adding a send home button would be nice if you need to save some income early on rough days or when accidentally overspending. \n",

      "-engineers not fixing the air pressure machine\n",

      "-achievements for earning money not working\n",
      "\n",
      "things to look into:\n",
      "-late game tends to lag \n",
      "-it seems that workers don't work as much as they should when they are assigned to work, possibly taking a while for the them to figure out the pathing to objective or \"insert something developer would say here\"\n",
      "-cars around the map all try to cram into one turn lane, sometimes there will be multiple cars clipping into each other\n",
      "\n",
      "possible changes:\n",
      "-selling product through phone orders compared to in store doesn't make sense; especially timed orders. \n",
      "example 1---3 star amazonian in store is sold for $495 per box but $1584 for 8 boxes through phone order.\n",
      "example 2---3 star clear in store is sold for $1000 per box but $3600 for 8 boxes through phone order.\n",
      "the math aint mathin on these sales. i know you get a little bit more for timed orders(which should be double or triple since its such a short amount of time) but this needs to change.\n",
      "-lower the cost of appliances. it shouldn't cost $50 per appliance a day to run some heaters/lights/etc. not so much a problem later in the game but those costs add up when you're riding the struggle bus early game.\n",
      "-tweaks to the monuments. the building that gives you longer work hours could be changed so there is an unlock for 24/7 business operation.\n",
      "-timed missions and phone orders need to be worked out better. why timed side missions for special customers? they keep asking you to complete the orders anyways after rejecting them so why not just take the timer away.\n",
      "-when you buy a piece of land for the factory the price of the next land purchase increases. could just have every piece of land for the factory be $10,000 a piece. the entire main square would still cost almost $500,000 with that price point.\n",
      "-aoe needs to be better for everything. i don't want to put 3+ large heaters/ac units/humidifiers/etc into a small room for the 3 star rating when it should only take 1 or 2 of them.\n",
      "-ac/heater/lights/etc should all cap at 100 instead of the different numbers they are currently capped at. this could tie into the aoe mentioned above for better coverage.\n",

      "\n",
      "1st the game is absurdly slow with progression you will spend entire days with the game just running at max speed to make enough money to do anything, because employee limits are tied to land which is expensive to start you'll grow your operation so slowly that you wish something, anything would happen but this leads to the next problem. combind with how worthless your vehicles are til upgraded you've got alot of running the game in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "2, nothing ever happens; there's only 2 scripted events in the game where you can even be attacked from what i can tell, both times tied to progress. both of these attacks are not only completely unwinnable even if every single employee is a guard but there's a entire gameplay mechanic around hiring these guards and outfitting them, which you will never do since even if you could get attacked you don't have the employee limits to maintain any kind of force unless your leaving the game on overnight to afford half a coffee shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "3, logistic wise its nonexistant. you can't name routes, or vehicles, or set even the most basic of import limits for them to follow. so lets say you have a donut shop which is selling all 3 kinds of weed, you have space to store 12 of each. if you have 12 of #1, 10#2 and 0 of #3 and the vehicle pulls up with 1 of #1 and you got nowhere to put it, it will sit there forever til space is availible. this creates huge bottlenecks, which lead to workers sitting idle, customers complaining you don't have the right things availible for purchase, ect. \n",
      "\n",
      "4, ai workers work about 90% of 50% of the time. your only control over workers is what hours they work, and what tasks and rooms they can be in. you can't prioritize any task over another e.g. only haul to drivers if you have no weed #2 related jobs availible, ect you can only say do both and it's random what they'll do. \n",
      "\n",
      "a good example of this is mechanics who will ignore broken machines (which the game won't tell you why, supposedly theres a 20 tile radius they work in and what that means exactly is never explained) as they wander around randomly even directly past broken equiptment and you can only set room groups for them to work in, so you'd think it would be all the devices in those rooms right? wrong. \n",
      "\n",
      "5 lastly, setting up your actual base is also a pita. there's no options to manually make walls dividing rooms or the like. so in the case of say weed #2 and weed #3 having conflicting requirements you'll need to seperate them by building completely superflous rooms with empty land inbetween instead of using a simple divider. doing this spreads the base out further, which breaks the ai further. most objects need the area infront of them completely unobstructed and can't share this space, which results in needing huge rooms to tetris objects in despite there being no reason why you can't make a trash can and soda machine can both face the same empty tile.\n",
      "\n",
      "i could go on about a laundry list of other issues, customer complaints that you can't do anything about decoration (cuz it doesn't exist) or tempature (doesn't affect people), quest's that have absurdly short deadlines that are near impossible to do without express knowledge their about to happen like npc jack asking for 20 of something in 10 in game minutes (hope you got 3 unused trucks and 4 pallets worth of it ready it's failed with a complete loss of all your stuff), ect ect. \n",

      "\n",
      "so outside of the u.i. being super unfun to navigate, the game isn't even all that fun. navigating from the map, to making your stores, to managing deliveries and scheduling routes/employee hours/open close is really not satisfying. the only time i felt even a little bit of that business owner enjoyment was getting a laundry mat to tier 3 and watching the happiness go up a bit along with going to 4 stars. it was only temporary though as there doesn't really feel like a goal. \n",

      "i enjoy the game quite much, sadly with its current state it is not very playable after you unlock the moon meth. it lags out to the point i'm questioning why i bought a 4k computer if i can't even have a couple laundry mats with a chicken joint. please fix the stability and performance! could you also maybe add a main menu button? i'm tired of closing the entire program to rerun it just to change saves.\n",

      "this is one of those games that i would love to keep playing but i can't because of the issues that are present. engineers will pace back a forth trying to get to a couple of things to repair but will never make it to any of them while the rest of you factory disintegrates because the engineer is stuck. i've had workers randomly start working jobs they aren't assigned to. the order of your employees and drivers in the ui will change after you save & exit the game then come back later. managing deliveries becomes very tedious once you have a bunch of drivers and there is no automation to deliveries. if one of your business' stock room fills up while you aren't watching? well that driver will sit in front of the business forever waiting to be unloaded. the ui is clunky and missing some basic features like \"exit to menu\". you have to exit to windows then relaunch if you want to get to the main menu. again, there is a lot of potential and i wish i could keep playing it, but i hope the developer focuses on getting the core of the game working well before adding more content because the content isn't going to matter when basic things don't work.\n",
      "super fun game.  i would wait until the full release though.  there are still a *lot* of bugs.  it also took me some trial/error/poking around to figure out that you have to set distribution for each vehicle individually, i couldn't understand why only one vehicle delivered while the rest just sat in their garage.  i thought it was a bug but it was just an unclear mechanic that isn't explained-- there are a few more issues like that, but that's the only one that stood out to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "also the aoe equipment is hit or miss right now, sometimes it works how it should and sometimes it doesn't.  this is understandable for a recently reworked feature in early access, but it's made it where i've decided not to play any more right now because equipment keeps exploding when it shouldn't (it has to be kept below a certain temperature and i've made sure that it is, but it just randomly starts a huge fire).\n",

      "the game would be much better if he just took a week and worked on it with nothing else. it'd also be better if he brought someone in to help with the interface / menus as the design makes windows 98 look good.\n",
      "\n",
      "for what this game was, i enjoyed it. if you're looking for something resembling breaking bad, this isn't it. this game is for the people who played dope wars on their calculators at school or who enjoyed outwar - a browser based mafia game.\n",
      "\n",
      "the closest thing to compare this game to is the sims and that would be a diservice to the sims.\n",
      "\n",
      "let this one cook a bit longer through ea and do not pay full price for it.\n",
      "this game is fun and addicting. its still early access so lots of things still in development, but looking at everything that will be available at 1.0 is pretty exciting. i've heard it was a rough start, but frequent updates and fixes have done the game a lot of good. the devs are doing a great job, and i look forward to playing this game some more through ea, and really can't wait for 1.0!\n",

      "definitly note its early access it has bugs but they are working on it ive been playing on and off since the release of early access and it is a great game and you can ask my girlfriend at how hyped i get for an update for a new playthrough i can wait for the final release\n",
      "i started playing this game at 10pm and when i checked my phone 30 minutes later, it was already 6 am.\n",
      "love love love this game! yes, it is a higher price point for an ea game, yes they do have some bugs and kinks to work out. however this game is everything i've wanted for so long and then some.\n",
      "\n",
      "the tutorial is pretty minimal but i prefer that almost, i like the trial and error play style. it's a bit slow in the beginning and once you get the hang of it it's a really fun game! it has it's quirks for sure. \n",
      "\n",
      "what i would like to see improved are the mechanics for when the antagonist attacks your warehouse with his minions. using the turrets or traps often harm your employees whenever they walk passed. which can be really annoying. i also find they can make it more challenging otherwise as they don't seem to attack often. \n",
      "\n",
      "another thing is we need a legend!!!!!! i dont like the fact the customers have little speech bubbles with emoticons in them and i have 0 idea what they mean half the time.\n",
      "it's like factorio, but without the crippling depression! every update and hotfix has been meaningful, well thought out, and frequent enough that you can tell this is definitely a passion project. the dev team really gets down to the brass tacks and fixes the biggest problems that trouble the community, as well as frequent quality of life improvements plus major game additions. i've always loved the fact that you can see upcoming items that will be available eventually. i can't wait to see this game in its full release state. i remember buying it for pretty cheap around its release, but it is definitely worth whatever the current asking price is. i would even go as far as to say, please give me dlc that i can buy. i feel like i owe them more money for all the hours of fun i've gotten out of this silly little base building, product managing, drug empire sim. i don't generally get involved in gaming communities but i'm about to jump into their discord just to goof around with other fans.\n",
      "even though the game lacks some content, i still had fun tinkering around with what there is.\n",
      "if you have 20 bucks to spare and some free time, i'd say go for it.\n",
      "huge potential, but would not buy it right now. many, and i mean many game breaking bugs, that u can't fix.\n",
      "yummy chicken and fun drugs! would recommend! 10/10\n",
      "great game. it's not even finished yet and i've spent over 100 hours playing\n",
      "bugs, i feel this will be a great game when the bugs are sorted out and the remaining content is unlocked.\n",
      "i enjoyed playing until i felt elements were out of my control (bugged), workers not doing their jobs, equipment not working as expected, features not clearly explained.\n",
      "happy fresh engineer looking for work next to damaged flammable equipment, chefs wearing latex gloves creating contaminated food, doughnut shop unable too get 5 star rating, laundromat operating hours unchanged by max monuments in every area. workers complaining about not using accessable facilities.\n",
      "maybe these are random features not bugs, happy engineer needs too be sacked?, latex gloves reduce contamination? doughnut shop is not ment too have all stars yet, laundromats arent effected by extended operating hours only restraunts? workers needs change every shift?. simply early access can be buggy or have unexplained features so early on, but for me this became tedious and unplayable until future patching.\n",
      "very good game, solo dev is incredibly nice\n",
      "welcoming community :)\n",
      "pro tip: make excellent drugs later in the game, you don't want to experience my first save\n",
      "hello! welcome to the los polo's hermanos family, my name is gustavo but you can call me gus.\n",
      "i entered the game started tutorial finished it and i uninstalled the game since i decided i can not continue with this game.\n",
      "\n",
      "1- tutorial is very very confusing.\n",
      "2 - ui and controls are very very complex and clunky. menu system is too complex.\n",
      "3- game layout/perspective has some visual problems that you can not understand where you place the objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "there should be a big patch to cover all of these aspects of the game. before this, stay away from this game.\n",
      "more addictive then the substances you make inside of it\n",
      "this game hits so many right buttons for me that i have to recommend it. while there are plenty of problems and updates don't come out at a regular pace, i still believe this is worth a buy even at its current state. \n",
      "\n",
      "where this game does right is the idea of building and maintaining both a lab and a front or fronts for your business of not selling chicken. usually you'd only be in charge of procuring and then distributing product, well now you also get to make a kfc to sell less than legitimate products alongside some tasty chicken. this is great and it pleases my simple brain when i do, finally, manage to create a positive cash flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "where this game doesn't quite hit the mark is from a number of ongoing issues. there are a number of bugs that can effectively keep you from playing. usually these are resolved by relauching the game, but having to do so multiple times per hour can become a real chore. this only becomes more tedious when loading times can be seen as on the long side(i currently have it on an ssd and it still takes a minute or two to get the game launched and back into my current save file.) \n",
      "\n",
      "lastly, is a certain amount of imbalances in the game itself. at the start the tutorial gives you a rundown of how to start and maintain a business/front. these are relatively charming and simple to understand as you go. however, it has a way of kicking you into the lions den the moment it's over. you help repair and restart a business for another company and the moment you finish the business portion of the tutorial you get fired on the spot. the tutorial takes this chance to introduce you to your very own sal lawyer guy as the explanation of the not chicken side of things. the problem with this is the fact that it doesn't set you up for success as soon as they are done feeding you this side of things. you have a barely functioning 'not chicken' lettuce supply and nothing else, it doesn't urge you to build a business outside of vaguely mentioning the teaching guides on the top before leaving you on your own. \n",
      "\n",
      "tutorial aside this is the least of your worries at the start. you have only a production of 'lettuce' and no fronts, so now what? well it gives you access to a group of bikes to deliver product, so that should be enough right? sadly this is another point for imbalance. your first orders over the request system is for eight pieces of 'definitely not fried chicken' each and each job has an output of somewhere between eight and nine hundred dollars. great! however your starting bikes can only hold one piece of lettuce and makes for horribly slow progress. this becomes only worse when you sell your first piece of lettuce from a front(if you manage to get so far as to start the first of the 'optional' side tutorials) and find that each piece of lettuce sold is worth almost four hundred dollars! so this basically makes any deliveries to these requests completely unprofitable. \n",
      "\n",
      "tl;dr \n",
      "\n",
      "where this game may have issues and i have a better ability to describe faults than praises due to my own inexperience with other management games like this to compare it to, it still manages to draw me in and peak my interest. i recommend it because it has so much potential and i want nothing more than to see where it goes as the developers put more love and care into it. \n",
      "\n",
      "after thought:\n",
      "\n",
      "i was made to write this after discovering the strange disconnect between front lettuce money gain and the requests. this was such a huge problem that i had to put it somewhere! please, developers, this is among your biggest issues that isn't the usual complaint about locked content. the balance between requests and fronts is astronomical and at the beginning the ability to actually survive as nothing but a dealer of 'not fried chicken' without a front is completely impossible without the access to trucks.\n",
      "atrocious ui\n",
      "very ea\n",
      "not worth $25\n",
      "\n",
      "the concept is nice! but the game has sooo many ui/ux problems. there's a long tutorial and even after you finish, you'll still be very confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "i really hope the game gets better, cause i would not buy it\n",
      "great game, great potential.... bit buggy\n",
      "i did had fun playing this game but it is early access and i did ran into some performance issues and game bugs. hopefully the developers will patch it soon.\n",
      "love this game can not stop play the bugs need sorting out. got new up date and then i cant make any more drugs and the people just all go to one area.   pls fix bugs\n",
      "the game is barely functional, and the devs just drop updates randomly with no notification. \n",
      " between things bursting into flames without indication of how to stop them from doing that, or how i honestly felt like this was a scam at first cause we keep getting radio silence from the development team. this game isn't even close to worth it until its fully released or unless we get an actual schedule of when updates/features are going to be added.\n",
      "this game hits all my buttons: old school play-style, management sim, drugs!\n",
      "\n",
      "cant wait for the updates\n",
      "extremely high potential to be a very fun game. fun now, but lacking a bit of content. \n",
      "\n",
      "i just really hope it doesn't get stuck in alpha access for 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "update: the 1.0 release is an improvement but it still has a long way to go.\n",
      "this game isnt worth 21 euros to me right now. its a great fun game but it doesnt have that much content since most of it is behind a early access lock (just that it comes later in ea) which includes some of the drugs (fun ones in my opinion) and some businesses ,vehicles etc. also the tutorial isnt that great and with or without the tutorial on day 1 u get attacked by 3 guys with smg's which just kill nearly everyone and make u lose tons of money iff u invested in 1 extra plot of land or a laundromat. at the moment of writing this i have refunded the game and waiting for a response.\n",
      "this game need alot updates. content and bug fixing. would not buy it right now. there is not much to do right now. and qol is also a concern. handling feels clunky. but yeah if they work on this and release all the content then i can see a good game and change my review.\n",
      "potential is there. was it worth the $30 aud i paid.......mmmmm not really.  this game has great potential and id love to see it finished. \n",
      "it says iv only played 7 hours but iv played it for about double that ( not sure whats going on there). end of 14hours iv got a massive wharehouse growing 2 strains. iv got two laundry mat fronts and a donut shop front, making loads of money per day. i feel at 14h there is nothing more to experience. 30 aud for 14h worth of fun....mmmm maybe it was worth my 30 bucks.... i think maybe im just worried this wont get finished as i will really be disappointing if it doesnt\n",
      "pretty difficult to get a hang of but once you get there it's pretty good, just waiting on the rest of the content to be added\n",
      "game has huge potential. hard to grasp at the start. tutorial is more story driven then actually showing the mechanics of the game. still months out from being fun and not worth $30 just yet.\n",
      "enjoying it, needs more updates but i see it being good in the future.\n",
      "so much game breaking bug, only 1-2 bug fixing per month. game needs 4-5 years if this update frequency remains same.\n",
      "so sloooow to start... my god it took me 2.3 hrs to finally get up and running... just long enough to no longer be able to request a refund.... don't recommend\n",
      "i have been playing since very early game and i have really enjoyed the game so far even with the bugs, yes at times it did frustrate me but over all the game has come together great and i love it and would recommend to anyone interested in the game. it has a breaking bad feel to the game which is what drew me in.\n",
      "quite a bit of fun. when you first start out its got a good learning curve and early game is difficult to get the hang of things but.... it has been a lot of fun. i cannot wait for the game to be fully finished! definitely recommend definitely not fried chicken!!\n",
      "good\n",
      "i would like to recommend this game, however it has a long way to go before i would be able to do that. there is so much in the game marked with ea to show what it will have but yet to implement, there is little to no automation at this time, and many of the tiered upgrades such as lighting and heating are bugged and give no additional benefits completely wasting your time. definitely check back as this game is developed, but as of now, it is \"definitely not\" worth the money\n",
      "ich verkaufe nur hühnchen und donuts... wirklich...\n",
      "silly and time consuming - i love it!\n",
      "this game is so bad, i played it now for 9 hours and i had to restart 4 times bc of bugs or glitches, i can only say it is not the money worth.\n",
      "(so i have about 10 hours more and the game got many updates, and i can say its much better.\n",
      "there are many things that i still dont unterstand but, now i think i can say its the money worth.)\n",
      "the game is fun and after the aoe updates it feels like everything is working as it was intended to. \n",
      "\n",
      "the game needs to be optimized a little more once you have a few businesses and a decent sized drug warehouse the frames start to drop. \n",
      "\n",
      "the ai isnt the best i tried separating my weed and meth warehouses so my meth stuff wouldnt kill my weed workers made room groups and made sure both warehouse had their own bathrooms, kitchen, and break rooms. the ai decided to go to the other warehouses for their breaks meth workers go to weed break room, weed workers died in the meth lab trying to take a break. had to put space helmets on my weed workers so they stopped dying.\n",
      "\n",
      "the tutorial should walk you through the \"criminal training programme\" it took me a couple hours to figure out how to actually play the game but i was high :). \n",
      "\n",
      "overall its a good game definitely worth a try.\n",
      "got me clucked up\n",
      "if the game was finished or even just worked - it'd be 10/10.\n",
      "\n",
      "but it's not and it doesn't. and what little gameplay that is finished, breaks more times than it will ever work. i can in no way recommend this game in any capacity. it's fun for about an hour til it starts bugging and the gameplay breaks. after that, it's nothing but frustration and wasted effort.\n",
      "good game at its core but badly designed ui, so hard to navigate\n",
      "i was kind of guttered as i seen the trailers and thought it was going to be the same but all the good stuff you can see is missing ! its there in the menus but all planned for later, in my opinion they should have waited to release it and got the better content out as now its going to be shelved until there is more stuff added. you aim to get to a point but then soon realise that its not possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "please get this stuff out and released or i can see a trend that there will be a lot more bad reviews. when its released and the game has more than a hours worth of content then ill be ready to change this review. \n",
      "\n",
      "i can see the game being really good but you guys have to prove it and make it happen !\n",
      "really enjoying this game, although what i thought were bugs were just me being silly. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. after i got attacked, i forgot you have to reassign the new staff \n",
      "2. found it difficult to find business, but if you click on the icon under the second option, it will take you there\n",
      "\n",
      "love the concept and the idea, really looking forward to see how this develops.\n",
      "pretty solid for beta, needs some refining for certain quality of life ui stuff and gameplay. kinda hard to make money when you need 100 heaters 50 humid's and a shit ton of lights and you cant sell anything at night.\n",
      "breaking bad meets chick-fil-a simulator\n",
      "very fun game to play for hours, some bugs here and there but that's what you expect for a early access game, i love the concept that the game brings and game play looking forward do the full game.\n",
      "this one of those games that has potential, it's just not quite there yet. i'll explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "right now it's two main issues are, lack of content (but there is plenty planned.) and issues with general game logic.\n",
      "the lack of content is pretty much a guaranteed when considering early access titles, so i'll give this issue a free pass. however, there needs to be some major changes logic-wise in order for me to turn this frown upside down.\n",
      "\n",
      "the building system is, how should i put it, rudimentary at best. there are certain exclusion zones around items that do not need to exist. for example, each tile can only hold one object, the tile adjacent to the object is it's 'interaction zone', you cannot place objects within an interaction zone, or overlap interaction zones. this is a big issue as, for example, doors have an interaction zone on either side. thus making the building of rooms clunky. you can't, for example, put a door next to a microwave, a uv light (which hangs from the ceiling) over a planter and plenty more other small, yet highly frustrating issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "the logistics system is similarly frustrating. if your business fills up on a particular stock, lets say regular cannabis, the car delivering 2 units of cannabis, 1 unit of toasted and 1 unit of amazonian will sit there forever until you eventually sell 2 units of regular cannabis and the vehicle is now empty. this clogs up the system and is highly inefficient, with larger logistics vehicles planned this will only get worse. \n",
      "what it should do is make a check to see if the assigned stores are full and if so, return to the depot or go to the next delivery assignment. better yet, have the store check for what it needs and make the request from the factory to begin with.\n",
      "\n",
      "workers need a priority list of assignments. if there are customers waiting to be served and a logistics vehicle waiting to be emptied and you only have limited employees, the player should be able to decide which they want to tackle first. rather than have to employ far more employees than necessary to cover all bases at all times. just as with the logistics, this is highly inefficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "right now, i cannot recommend this game. within a few hours i've pretty much seen all there is to see and spotted a few major issues that will grind the game down as more content is added. as far as the gameplay loop is concerned, it's great. it just needs a lot more mechanical refinement and about another year or two in the oven before it's ready. i don't regret spending the money as i see good potential in the future.\n",
      "too many bugs and not enough content at the moment.\n",
      "in short:\n",
      "fun, though a lot of bugs and very limited content make the game really rought around the edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "the game has a lot of potential, but is a bugfest in it's current state.\n",
      "a lot of content from the trailer is missing aswell, and you can only exit to the desktop once you are in the game. there also isn't a proper load option in game for the time being.\n",
      "i still had fun playing the game, tho the times i had to restart because of bugs, and running out of content pretty quick made my experience not as nice, as it could be.\n",
      "so for the time being no recommendation from me.\n",
      "i do have high hopes for the game though, since the devs keep in touch with the community, and want feedback and bug reports.\n",
      "devs, you are doing a great job, keep your heads up.\n",
      "i am excited for future updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "bugs i encountered:\n",
      "when you hire while in light mode (?) your employees are grey. -can be fixed by restarting.\n",
      "sometimes you can't delete rooms. -can be fixed by restarting.\n",
      "hire button doesn't work. -can be fixed by restarting.\n",
      "after the tutorial when the three chicken guys kill your whole facility. noone bothers you anymore (no more raids/no need for guards). -couldn't find a way to fix\n",
      "ai gets confused when too many interactable things are close to each other. -can be fixed by moving objects or doors and giving them more space to walk.\n",
      "aoe objects still work when they are broken -(no clue if that's a bug or not, but it feels like one)\n",
      "you can pick up burning equipment and sell it -\n",
      "room placing is bugged sometimes. either you can't build one, or the floor is missing, and they can walk through the walls.\n",
      "same happens if you extend a room, just that you can't walk into the extention from inside. (i hope you understand) -can be fixed by restarting.\n",
      "the game is in a very early state. lots of bugs (nothing too serious though) and very little content. after a few hours i've seen, done, unlocked, built and optimized pretty much everything the game has to offer and repeated it twice. now i don't have any reason to play again until a lot of new content gets implemented. at the moment this game is not much more than a demo.\n",
      "the game has great potential, it looks good, the game mechanics are promising and the story was fun so far. this could become one of the most fun games of the genre. i really want to see what the developer will make of it within the next year. but at this early stage i can't really recommend it. even for early access, it's much to early.\n",
      "it is a good game in all, and a really good concept, however, the ui just seems rushed and needs to be reworked. i will defo start playing more when there has been a rework of the ui.\n",
      "this game is fucking awesome!\n",
      "good game hoping for more content plz\n",
      "the game is very fun, but it takes too much time. the main problem for me is, that if you set the speed on 3 times faster it feels like 1,5 times faster. that leads to a situation where you're always waiting for money because the time between the opening time of your shops and the time for the deliveries are just too slow.\n",
      "\n",
      "even if it is too slow at the moment, i recommend it, because it is already fun and i'm sure that it will improve in many ways in the next 6 month, when the game is supposed to be released.\n",
      "just go to the discord and you'll see, that they all say what the steam reviews are saying and the devs are always responding to their requests and submissions.\n",
      "really chill tycoon game that turns into an idle game after a couple hours which i personally didn't mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "couple of things to take into consideration however..\n",
      "\n",
      "-game is super slow. even on 3x speed the game is really slow. i actually never played on a slower speed and still wished it could go way faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "-game runs super slow. specs aren't an issue here. it's just laggy. i get a maximum of 5-10fps at current (four stores built and about a quarter of the factory land is purchased so i imagine the game will chug down to 1fps if i play further and continue building.\n",
      "\n",
      "currently this is like a 5/10 but has the potential to climb way higher if the fps issues are fixed and the game has faster speed settings \n",
      "\n",
      "edit: with multiple performance updates i still do not exceed 10fps and i can guarantee the computer is not the problem.. unplayable as of right now.\n",
      "fun game to be honest, lost a few hours in it straight away, its in early access so lots of annoying bugs, such as cars glitching or freezing for 5 mins before moving 1cm to freeze again, also when you change layout. sometime staff walk through walls or cant find the new bedroom or kitchen etc, which then makes it hard to expand or try to move on in the game. overall yes its fun and good but can be way better.\n",
      "great game once you get the hang of playing it you can do some crazy stuff. hopefully they keep rolling out updates\n",
      "15 min was enough,\n",
      "\n",

      "- creative style\n",
      "- great direction as early access progresses\n",
      "- very well thought out attempt at granularity (which will be amazing over time as i'm sure it will be adjusted)\n",
      "- overall a fun time\n",
      "\n",
      "the bad:\n",
      "- people seem to get awkwardly stuck at random times. had a line of workers stuck on a single hand dryer, laundromat workers spawning in an adjacent shop and getting stuck (never making it to work and hosing one of my businesses for a short while)\n",
      "- dispatch locations will sometimes overlap, making it almost impossible to click new locations underneath existing locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "the ugly:\n",
      "- this game memory leaks horribly. over the course of an hour, i've watched my memory consumption go up 4gb. once i save, exit, and load back in, it goes back down and slowly climbs up another 4gb over the next hour.\n",
      "- reloading a save (especially after clearing up the memory leak) completely clears dispatch routes. this makes it a nightmare loading back in when you have a lot of active orders\n",
      "this game is still in early access and its a fun to play or pass your time, it has some bugs but the developer is active and is fixing them quickly overall great game 9/10 i would recomend it and it has potential!\n",
      "i just absolutely love this game.\n",
      "\n",
      "jon't be stupid like me and lock your games every 5 seconds by performing the floor glitch (deleting the space of x room type when you're currently on d room type). i've had to restart like 10 times but for me it's been worth it.\n",
      "it's early access. but it's a great idea and i love the feel of the game. can't wait for further updates!\n",
      "its fun\n",
      "its a fun game, my first \"management tycoon\" game for sure. as of now with my 8 hours in im in starting stages of getting cloud made. the game does have a bit of grinding and as of your first hit on you you have no need for guards. best way to make money isnt to sell to your hotline but to your businesses (the intro requires it and thank god you can turn it off). minor bugs such as the employees dropping product and \"contaminating\" them. there is also a bit of high memory usage. with 32 gb of ram it pegs it at 70-75 percent. along with the occasional frame drop (dropping settings doesnt seem to help) every time i save/autosave. i carry high hopes and will continue to play in my offtime\n",
      "this game is early access to the extreme and should be treated as such. it plays like something barely past the proof of concept stage in terms of polish.\n",
      "\n",
      "it has tons of bugs, ui quirks, and the early game goes so slow that you really can't get to the other content in the game.\n",

      "\n",
      "staff caps seem completely backwards, i can have 15 staff for my laundromat, but only 4 for my factory making all my product? seems way imbalanced and makes getting off the ground very very difficult in the early game.\n",

      "still fun, i'm a sucker for a good concept, seems like it will be a fun game with some (rather significant at time of writing) polish.\n",
      "heisenberg aint got shit on me....\n",
      "game is amazing, highly recommended for ea. start yourself a little weed grow, open a laundry mat, and see what happens. excited to see what they do with this, turn on that meth production. :) keep those updates coming, shouts to the dev and studio on this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "its a fun and silly game. there is a lot of potential with this and i'm looking forward to the progression. the game reminds me a lot of breaking bad tbh.\n",
      "this game has so much potential i love it so far\n",
      "good\n",
      "i got my hopes up as dnfc was a game i was looking forward to play with all of content showed in the trailers but a lot of is locked. i wouldn't recommend to get the game at its current state as it has a long way to go because apparently its an early access launch within an early access.\n",
      "\n",
      "you get 3 front businesses to setup and run, 3 types of weed production and 1 type of meth production and that's it. the rest is locked away in early access hahaha! the game at its core is pretty fun. by setting up the fried chicken business you get to feel like you're the boss of los pollos hermanos. other than that, the delivery of product needs a lot of work. if not micromanaged, the products will get delivered to the wrong store. there is a garage indicator on the map but it doesn't show which is a car or a moped right until it leaves out for delivery. workers may stop working, the ui is basic and pretty straight forward. doesn't take too long getting used to it. graphics are okay as the main focus is production and delivery of products to your customers and how you can improvise and create a better and faster production line. i feel it should be more that just 4 worker slot for each plot purchased to produce your products. \n",
      "\n",
      "there are a lot of improvements to be made to this game and i hope the devs will deliver the rest of the early access content soon and make more interesting content for the game. i will give this a thumbs up but i wouldn't want you to spend your money on something that is still baking. get the game when the early access is fully launched with all of its content unlocked.\n",
      "gus fring simulator\n",
      "i played this game for about 3 hours now, that isn't a lot of time to get that far in the game but what pisses me off is that for some reason when i load back in the screen is stuck on blue. the day time is 00:00, and my money is set to 0. i have done 2 new saves of the game starting over and all of them ended up having a blue screen premanently. i wouldn't recommend, this game is unplayed\n",
      "this game is just brilliant fun, bug yes, plenty of bugs yes, but that isn't enough not to enjoy it, it's simply relaxing fun to play and well worth buying, hopefully the devs will iron out the little issues sooner rather than later as i'm loving it, 2 weeks and 100 hours of playing it, need some updates soon though\n",
      "i recently got my hands on the early access of \"definitely not fried chicken\" and let me tell you, it's a clucking good time! the graphics are finger-lickin' good and the controls are crispy and responsive. the storyline is so juicy, i can't wait to see how it will all pan out in the full release.\n",
      "\n",
      "but, there are a few cons to this early access version. the menu options are a bit limited, making it hard to navigate and find what you're looking for. and sometimes, the character's dialogue feels a little dry and under-seasoned. but these minor issues aside, i'm definitely looking forward to getting my beak into the full release of this game.\n",
      "\n",
      "in conclusion, \"definitely not fried chicken\" is shaping up to be a tasty and enjoyable game that's worth a try. so grab your friends and get ready for some feather-flying fun!\n",

      "don't waste your money way to many bugs give it about a year then it may be playable\n",
      "this game is really cool but whenever i fire a worker in my laundromat they leave but don't get fired and i cant hire anymore employees. also $50 has been stuck to my cursor like this entire time. would be cool if the security guards had some purpose, you never even get raided or nothing. the 20x good quality quest with the astronauts shouldn't have a time limit if it saves your progress.\n",

      "good yes. excited to hunt the achievements for this game :) great game concept and play so far. can not wait to see the game post beta branch !\n",
      "having so much fun with this game so far, it's not hard to figure things out, but a couple things could be tweaked. first allow products in vehicles be taken out or don't let that product be dropped off at hotlines if it's the wrong item. second, have a queue waiting times for hotlines instead of the drivers taken ridiculous routes to get back to the destination. third, allow us to move product off of storage shelves without having to loose all the product by picking up the shelf. i have encountered some bugs nothing really game breaking yet, mainly menu items not going away and staying with the cursor, also pro tip, specially with cooking food, just because you have an outfit to cook faster at least for now, i wouldn't recommend using them because the workers constantly drop items making them contaminated.\n",
      "this game is great.\n",
      "the updates to come are easily anticipated\n",
      "love the resource management/economic aspects.\n",
      "plus the selling of illicit wares gets a certain neuron's juices flowing.\n",

      "the save function is terrible also you cant even load from the same menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "the building mode bugs and because there is no return to main menu screen i have to save the game, exit the game, open the game and load my save back up. this happens alot!\n",

      "a lot of what you see in the trailer even the old trailers isn't even in the game yet, which is crazy to me and its kind of misleading, seeing some of these things in trailers from upto as far as 2 years ago in the game but still not available to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "lets go over some.\n",
      "\n",
      "the truck is not in the game, its heavily featured in a trailer from 2 years ago (source: https://youtu.be/obve1emeuq8) you can't even use the pickup truck yet either which is shown in a trailer from 5 months ago (source: https://youtu.be/ysw-lzuuraw)\n",
      "\n",
      "you can't make a cocaine operation or a meth lab like in the 2 year trailer either, only 1 item to make meth so far in the game. these operations are even featured in the .gif that is in the games steam page under the \"about this game\" section.\n",
      "\n",
      "at the moment only 3 guns currently in the game, sawn off shotgun, pistol and a submachine gun. but the trailer from 2 years ago also showed the heavy sub machine gun so far the game only has 3 out of 11 guns.\n",
      "\n",
      "a lot of business you cannot make in the game yet such as the lobster restaurant, nightclub and casino.\n",
      "\n",
      "there is a lot more things missing from the game and i am sure they will add it in later down the road but i have to be honest and i am pretty fed up of being mislead by the gaming industry today whether it be aaa or indie devs both are guilty of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "i may edit some things in the review as i play more but for now this is it.\n",
      "\n",
      "should you buy it now? probably not maybe in a year or 2.\n",
      "review updated!\n",
      "\n",
      "really fun and detailed game! development has been progressive with a lot of neat features and updates throughout the time i've had it.\n",
      "i definitely don't recommend this game keeps shutting off on me when ever i try to do something on it and i gotta start all over again waste of money ied wait till the full game is out maybe i'll be fix and work better.\n",
      "would not recommend  purchasing. currently it is in a very broken state. the most recent \"hotfix\" 06/02/23 has caused the game to be basically unplayable.\n",
      "\n",
      " the core aspects of the game are great if the game had more content and was less buggy i would 100% recommend. however right not id save your money and wait a month or so and check back. this game has great potential however due to the single developer bugs can't be fixed or features implemented as fast so id wait till its more stable. if you want to know its current state at whatever point you may be reading this you can find there discord and check.\n",
      "really liking this one and its early access too, some stuff is locked off due to access of the game being early but aside that there's enough in this to grind out and micro manage has a lot of potential if this project carries on well and the simple graphics wont push your pc to breaking point so all good there.\n",
      "loading time on initial load sucks right now (06/02/2023) on initial load it will get stuck at 25 percent for a bit u will think the game has crashed but give it some time.\n",

      "tutorial is easy to follow and the rest of the game follow simple progression and easy to understand layout.\n",

      "\n",
      "iv played a good few hour of this on my channel and have enjoyed the vibes of the game and hanging out with my viewers sharing this game with them\n",
      "i love it\n",
      "dnfc really scratches that itch for a good business simulation game. the content is a bit lacking at the moment since its in ea, but it has a great foundation for a gem. if the dev's keep adding more content in all areas of gameplay, then i can see this becoming a \"must have\" game. the different businesses you can choose from are all awesome, i only experienced a few glitches. i will say the very beginning of the game is pretty tough. i have to start over a  few times. it definitely feels like late alpha/early beta stage. \n",
      "\n",
      "i recommend this game for anyone who has a little patience (since the tutorial and ui are a little lacking), and someone who likes business sim / automation games. i'm rooting for the devs, as i would love to see more content and continue my empire\n",
      "this game concept is really good, i can officially say that i am addicted. however there are a few bugs that make it almost unplayable later on:\n",
      "-  the employees of the three available businesses are not able to serve clients, which stay in queue infinitely\n",
      "- after you fire a worker and he does not display anymore in the list of workers of a business, he won't go home, just walk around the shop with the task \"going home\". that means that the total number of workers will not decrease, leaving the player with an even smaller availability of workers.\n",
      "- deleting a shift schedule results sometimes in not being able to reassign workers at a different one or fire them. the game will automatically set them with a $700 a day salary and they will not do any task\n",
      "- workers of the drug factory will not work after you reassign them to another task\n",
      "\n",
      "also please add the possibility for workers of the drug factory to sleep. they are always tired and drop the products on the floor to go to sleep.\n",
      "also the feature to name and reorder the list of employees will be a nice feature, maybe adding a small preview of how they look and what clothes they are wearing could be a nice idea to make the game more intuitive.\n",
      "add the possibility for the cars to automatically collect the product required for deliveries and stop giving away what for free what the deliver doesn’t ask for or what has already been satisfied\n",
      "\n",
      "i’m sorry for my bad english, i know the developers will do wonders with this game!\n",
      "\n",
      "the game has potential, but it has a ton of bug for now. i am not very recommended for this game. \n",
      "also there a lot things you can see from the trailer is not online yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "i got twice 'stuck on loading 75%' issues.  after i heard them fixed it on beta version, i switched to it and i tried it. yes, it is no more 75% stuck but i got another issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "what is my issue? here is the story: \n",
      "when i was buying a gear to my employee, the auto save function just come up in a wrong time. it causes me can't manual save anymore for some unknown reason and the save icon keep showing on the top right. so i restart my game, restart usually can fix 99% glitches in this game. unfortunately, after i restarted the game i find out i can't purchase anything, my whole business just disappeared from the world, and the game day, money and the time also reset to 0. \n",
      "\n",
      "the game just kill my three different runs, i am tired of it, i don't want to try it anymore. i guess i will do my fourth run when the studio officially complete the game. i am very sad about the current status of the game. \n",
      "  \n",
      "btw: the auto save function is stupid, they didn't create an auto save slot, instead the auto save just rewrite your manual save slot. \n",
      "also we truly need a 'save as' function and a 'return to title' button.\n",
      "pretty fun, and look like they are working on it efficialy.\n",
      "i installed this game 6 hours ago and i'm obsessed. so far i'm only running 2 businesses but with detailed management of employees time and focusing on delivery routes i've turned a nice profit. i'm looking forward to the variety of other businesses.\n",
      "yes it is ea, yes it is buggy still and yes it probably is a little expensive in it's current state but overall the game is still pretty awesome. the idea is great, the art style is fun and very retro and pretty soon you will be delivering your product all over the map. there is an active discord server where the dev does respond to people and i truly believe they are doing their best to work through the various issues. there is still plenty more to come in the coming updates as currently you can only produce 3* cannabis and 1* meth, use 3 of the fronts for you business and can only upgrade to a car for deliveries to your customers, what there is available at the moment though is still great fun to play and i look forward to the updates in the coming weeks/months.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"it's over, i won\"\n",
      "++\n",

      "game is in ea so there are a few bugs. besides that a very fun game hope the continue to make improvements.\n",
      "super fun game about building a drug empire. i cannot wait for updates to expand the product line into higher quality crystal and cocaine.\n",
      "ive loved every hour of playing this game so far can see a lot more to be released in the upcoming updates of the game so far the business side is spot on the amount of staff you need is correct and the just pure enjoyment is unreal i cant wait for the upcoming updates to add more products and more vehicles for transport.\n",
      "game won't start after installing, even tried the new \"beta branch\" update, but still won't start. made a thread on the discussion section called: \"game crash after fresh install\". sadly i had to refund because of that.\n",
      "fun twist on the business sim. love the fried chicken aspect.\n",
      "new take on simulation games; looking forward to updates.\n",
      "after them fixing the save glitch issue and losing hours of game play, the game is enjoyable. just waiting on the last part of their release!\n",
      "the game has potential but currently barely has any content. i played 5 hours and feel like i already did everything possible in the game twice. the ui is also horrible. currently the game is not worth it for the price. wait for major updates or for a sale\n",
      "good game in general.\n",
      "but there's some memory leak problem on steam deck once you build up your drug factory with multiple workers.\n",
      "game run totally fine on steam deck if you only play with the legit business without the drug factory, like i could idle for a night and it is still working.\n",
      "this game is amazing. after 1 restart i managed to run up 2 laundromats, 2 chicken joints and a donut shop and almost 2 million in profit. the game has major potential but almost just as many flaws. you will be attacked maybe twice thru out your play-through by one person(you two are the only business men in town). so don't expect shootouts and gang warfare fighting over turf. a very high percentage of the game is locked(check the road map). with 2 million dollars and the game just making endless money i've now lost interest. you have nothing to spend your money on so even with the unlocks of bigger business later on, i see no point. give us mansions an avatar to customize and an entourage or something(think scarface the ps2 game). i just feel like a tycoon not a drug lord. still a quality game but lets see how this turns out.\n",
      "can't.....stop.......playing!!\n",
      "saves are a bit wonky right now so i've just been approaching each play session with a rogue-like mentality.  management sims are some of my favorites and this one definitely scratches an itch in a sub-genre of sim games.  keep it up please :)\n",
      "great early access game; cannot wait to see final product!!\n",
      "super fun needs balancing and either a wiki with tips or a reddit thread of info. some people dont have discord\n",
      "very good tycoon game, has some rough edges and many bugs, but it made by 1 person.  for how fun the game is, a very strong recommendation if you like management tycoon game, though remember it a early access and has 1 sole dev at the publishing of this review, be patience with it.\n",
      "i am enjoying this very much. yes, it has some issues but hey what game doesn't in early access. i grabbed it while it had 10% off. i am very much looking forward to the updates and watching this game turn into a gem. glad i picked it up and will patiently wait for it to blossom.\n",
      "gus fring approves of this game.\n",
      "great concept of a game. need a lot of updates.\n",
      "very fun addicting game where i lose countless hours in. i can't recommend it with the state of the bugs that are present, i have done 4 playthroughs and once you get built up far enough the game doesn't load past 75%. i'm guessing saves get corrupt somehow but at this point i think it is best to wait until they address the problem before purchasing.\n",
      "addicting as drugs\n",
      "definitely fun,  although because of the nature of early access it is missing some features. but what is present is promising.\n",
      "going to have to refund and perhaps come see if its improved enough later to buy. when purchase it was $24 which is way too high for how buggy and incomplete the game is, that is not an ea price for me. good premise though but asking for too much from players with that pricing vs current game quality.\n",
      "its a great game with a decent amount of stuff to do. \n",
      "there are some issues like the ai pathing and people showing up to work. sometimes they are really early sometimes insanely late or just wont show at all. all of this is supposed to be fixed in a patch soon.\n",
      "potential to be a great game. i recommend this game for purchase, but only after they do a hotfix for the crashing and re loading of save files.\n",
      "i had to refund, might visit later. i know it's early access  but i don't feel the price reflects the state the game is in right now. it's just so, so buggy....  a lot of the mechanics / icons / functions are not explained at all and most of them don't have tooltips when you hover over them to learn what they do..  \n",
      "\n",
      "listening to my employees continually go in and out doors was driving me mad, it seems they spend more time walking around back and forth from the staff room than they do working, regardless of their custom schedule.  you can only save one game from the settings menu, quitting the game kicks you back to windows instead of the main menu, resolution can't be changed as far as i could see... the list goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "i really like the concept but it's got a long way to go to earn the price they are selling it for in my opinion, it needs to be fleshed out a lot more.  should be around £9 for the state the game is in right now, which they could obviously bump up as the game gets completed over time.  will keep my eye on it and possibly visit again in the future.\n",
      "nice\n",
      "going into this knowing its and early access game by a solo developer, i had so much fun with it. i've pretty well done everything you can at this point in ea and i had a blast. i encountered a few bugs while playing, like a couple employees just stopped coming to work so i'd have to fire and rehire them. some texture bugs with floors not changing while building or modifying rooms. and the unit that is supposed to remove toxic fumes seems to add more? but all were easily fixed by just rebooting the game. other than that i think it's incredibly fun with a fair bit to do already. i can't wait to see where it goes from here.\n",
      "tldr; really fun concept, game does have promise. many issues need fixing. not worth the price at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "review: after spending a decent amount of time in this game, in it's current state i can't recommend buying it. too much needs to be done.\n",
      "issues: \n",
      "* character ai is terrible. nothing worse than people you are paying to do a job standing around. (they are fixing this as a priority)\n",
      "* monuments do not work (known issue, added to the list)\n",
      "* \"upgraded\" equipment does not offer any additional benefit (known issue)\n",
      "* delivery path finding needs work. time sensitive deliveries and my drivers are doing circles around the block.\n",
      "* two \"employees\" per purchase of production land is just not enough, needs re-balancing / increasing or have security personnel as it's own capacity and separated from workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "technical issues:\n",
      "* poorly optimised. once your empire is \"big\" then game performance just tanks.\n",
      "* after a relatively decent amount of playtime it chews through my ram, using in excess of 10gb\n",
      "* random crashes, usually jumping from owned properties/fronts via the menu icon. (save often)\n",
      "* ui elements just stop working and are unresponsive randomly. character equipment sheet and interacting with placeable objects mainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "all this is known to the devs and i'm sure there are other issues i just have not raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "note to devs: please change the default settings for any object that can be \"filtered\" for accepted items to nothing (default is set to accept everything) upon placement rather it would be better to let me filter manually after placement. examples include: storage shelves, delivery vehicles, processing equipment.  there is nothing more annoying than trying to add storage/delivery route for meth (or other products) and your workers charge in with hands full of everything else and start throwing it on a shelf. this is a qol improvement that in my opinion is just needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "overall, when this game has had some more work and optimisation done to it, it will be a very chill, fun game. i will revisit this in the future and if they fix the issues i will change my recommendation but for now i cannot recommend it. give it time.\n",
      "\n",
      "edit: grammatical and conciseness changes.\n",
      "i don't write a lot of reviews and i don't usually buy ea games but sometimes there is one that is just... too compelling not to.  the game is campy, fun, definitely clever, and difficult enough.  a lot of features are \"coming soon\" and the game is missing some optimizations still but yet.. i can't stop playing! don't take it too seriously; the devs are very active and i think over time this will continue to grow into a fully complete game.  worth $25? i've got 10 hours of it so far and will likely dump quite a bit more time in so... yes. recommend, even in this state of completion.\n",
      "currently, this game has many frustrating bugs and issues, and with 90% of the game not released yet, it's hard to give it a positive review. yet i'm leaving one because the 5 hours i got from the 10% of the game was enjoyable, and i see a future with a game and its concept if it's executed correctly, and only if the issues are fixed: the game is slow, the pacing of the game feels slow in the early phases which can be improved how much staff you can hire per land tile, up to 3-4 instead because 2 workers with the best automation cant cover a whole tile. increase the cargo to 2 on the bike because, again early game, all you're doing is waiting around for money. i will come review again in a couple months and if nothing changes or gets improved i am changing my review\n",

      "all my game time so far has been on the steam deck, so first of all, the games aesthetic is fitting and well done, it has that 80’s vibe as advertised. i’m not sure where the dev is from, but back in the 80’s we used to have these coffee/hot chocolate machines that look exactly like one of the drink machines in dnfc. i keep one in my drug factory kitchen, makes me smile every time i see it, reminds me of those sweet molten hot-hot chocolates at a hockey game/practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "another thing i really enjoy is the almost perfect balance of micromanagement and idler type of gameplay, there is just the right amount of mix, the drug making randos  require little input in to what they do, and more emphasis is placed on fine tuning your operations to find the right schedules, planning workflow, etc to get the most efficient operation as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "however one thing i find the game lacks, for me anyway, would be an optional “refinement method”. for instance with weed, i think something like adding curing as an optional process, having a curing station which would take additional time at a slower progress rate. jar up the weed, let it sit for some time and add a “top shelf” quality level, or even a nutrient mix station which depending on your nutrient mix could make the plant grow mutant huge, crazy fast, double harvest amount. \n",
      "\n",
      "one major flaw i find at this point in the game would be i find the ui a tad clunky and unintuitive, but this is ea and i’m sure there are qol and ui refinements in the future so this really isn’t a dealbreaker in my books. my other gripes are largely related to a few bugs, but again, not a dealbreaker for me.\n",

      "good game now with a big potential and lots of rough edges in it's current state. now i have only played 2 hours so far but i can get an idea about a game from that. it's more indepth and engaging than i thought it would be. the \"clucky\" graphics you barely even notice after 15 minutes.  some things that need work. it would be fun if you could name your toons. maybe you can but i didn't notice if you could. the toons don't seem to upgrade their skills. which seems an obvious thing to do but maybe i didn't get far enough into the game yet? the tutorial is crap. to be honest, the things it explained well i could either figure out for myself or knew from other games. or the things i didn't, often the tutorial more confused me than helped me.  it can be confusing to figure out what the hell they are saying to do. several times i did what i thought was right but the tutorial wouldn't forward until i \"randomly\" tried other things. if you do something in the tutorial before it asks you to do it, you have to undo that thing and redo it for the tutorial to register that you did it. several times when it did forward, i got a black screen with a movable cursor that made me have to start over again. and one time the tutorial just would not forward to the next part no matter what i did. and i clicked on every possible thing i could have. i just got a arrow point to something to click on and when i clicked on that button a new screen came up with another arrow. i click on that button and it takes me back to the first screen. rinse and repeat. but none of these things seem to happen in the actual game. and i just skipped by the tutorial after awhile and was pretty much fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "some big annoying things in game is 1. you build these rooms with nice thick walls. but the toons don't respect the walls at all. they more often than not walk right through them. and when they don't walk through them they don't always take the quickest way to where they need to go. 2. if you build a room and decide to expand it later, the ground dosn't seem to expand with the room. in other words, what passes as dirt in the game stays as dirt for the floor and one room seems to have kept the original walls from the first build of the room but they don't affect the toon going to the new area. 3. when you first start the game, the main bad guy just sends a few of his overpowered troops to your place and wipes out everybody and everything. now you have to rehire and get an engineer to fix everything. why? it looks cute but more annoying than cute. 4. i really don't like having to hold the scroll wheel as you move the mouse to move around the screen and the right button to turn. it seems to me that should be reversed if anything. having basically skipped most of the tutorial, or maybe i really didn't because there is no hint at all that there was much more to it than i saw, i found myself unable to figure out how to upgrade the quality of my products. i.e. make better pot. it clearly says you can and i know putting lights in helps do this but they don't seem to be doing it so far. the first crop or two is high quality but after that it's all trash. even with the lights. it says certain things affect the quality but it really dosn't say what things you need to use to affect what or what the crop needs to be better quality. how does buying a \"front\" business help me? i know why in real life but not in game. and a few other things. also, there seems to be some sort of point system that when you get enough points it unlocks more items to use. i have no idea how that works but i seem to be getting points some how. hey, it's a pre release, these things are to be expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "having said all that, the game is a lot of fun and most of the things i complained about are minor easily fixable things you expect in a pre release. would i buy it again now knowing this? sure. it's playable and fun and it seems addictive. given more time i can find the answers i need or figure them out myself.\n",
      "good\n",
      "avoid this until they do more work on it. would freeze at 25% and crashed. never even got a chance to play and developer seems to be ignoring this specific issue. if things get better down the road, i'll change my review. until then, refunded.\n",

      "it takes a second to understand the mechanics of the game as well as the interface being horrid, the way to deliver the packages to customers messes up very frequently and i had to reorganize the order multiple times due to the system mixing them up, you will have to deselect a lot of the deliveries or they will keep going their, there is no automatic way for them to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "also, this game caused my keyboard to have a lag, when i uninstalled the game it fixed the issue, no idea why this game would cause a system malfunction in my keyboard. i would wait for the full release to buy this game, a lot of the content is left out and the game is very unfinished.\n",

      "edit post major patch 1: still rough, but getting better. fewer bugs overall, but it felt like i needed to restart the game more to get rid of some little issue than i remember. new content, but i didn't have the time to put in to get through the early game to try it. the time speed in this game seems a bit slow, and doing most things takes significant time and investment with often small margins for error. i would like to see some sort of a planning mode that works with the overlays, or at least the ability to sell purchased equipment within a short timeframe for the same price it's bough for, because figuring out ideal layouts can be tricky and take some trial and error. it sucks to have to eat the cost because the game doesn't give you a way to work it out without spending money.\n",

      "\n",
      "logistics plays a large role in everything on both a micro and macro scale. the distance between your workstations, the lengths of your hallways, and even the path your trucks must take to reach other destinations is something you'll want to keep in mind. i find that challenge stimulating, though i would like to see some further development. the ability to set task priorities for workers, box and ship intermediate production items (like uncooked donuts, for example), and the ability to set custom routes for transports would be great. to go from great to incredible would be implementing rotating availability of a larger number of purchasable properties and logistic hubs like warehouses or garages to allow for more complex supply chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "this game has plenty of positives, but i currently would only recommend this to people who really enjoy management style games who are willing to support an unfinished game that shows potential. some of the bugs currently being worked on should have been found with just regular play testing before release, there were some choices that felt like they were the result of a rushed release, and this game is too new to know for sure how the devs will progress, but i'm rooting for this game and i think it could be great.\n",

      "so far, this game is a pretty good example of \"ea\" that people complain about the most.  i've been following this game for a year or 2 and was excited to see it finally out.  i normally don't have a problem with ea games and still can find some fun in them, but this game makes it hard to.\n",
      "\n",
      "first off, it's the same ol' tale that you are seeing on reviews for this game: tutorial sucks.  it really sucks.  it has you do the bare minimum and then just...stops.  i can't really say it just \"stops.\"  more like that common movie trope where the dying old man is about you tell you the biggest secret in the whole universe but just gasps and dies.  like yoda, about to tell luke about vader, but just disappears into thin air.  yeah, that's how this tutorial works out. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "like others have said, time is slow and i wish they fully explained it so i will.  unlike games like the sims, two point series, planet coaster/zoo, when you hit the fast forward buttons, time moves very fast.  this game's option is normal, normalish, normallishish. see, you need to make deliveries to get paid, but the city is rather large and it takes quite a while to make a delivery.  not to mention, each delivery requires 7 drop offs to get paid (which, btw, the tutorial never talks about). clicking on the fastest option doesn't really help a thing.  i'm not asking to skip an entire day but can we have a sense of urgency?\n",
      "\n",
      "then there are several upgrades and items that have literal \"ea\" on them. i mean, that is expected in an early access title.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "if for some reason you still want to get this game i have to tell you, be prepared to start a new game a few times until you can figure this mess out.  however, and this drives me crazy, if you need to start a new game, the only option you have is to exit out of the whole game, open the game up again in steam and then choose a new game. there is no way to \"exit to main menu.\"  i don't understand how basic menu features are none existent in this game that allows you to have multiple saves.  \n",
      "\n",
      "i love management games and this one is unique and right up my alley.  however, they decided to be a little too unique with their strange design choices, that i can't recommend this game as is.  i can see this game being better in 6 months and even \"great\" by the time it leaves early access.  devs have already been acknowledging a lot of the bugs and hopefully some qol.  as for now, wait a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "[h1]updated review:[/h1] \n",
      "\n",
      "so, i've added several hours to this game but don't let that you fool you.  in order to get a good chunk of money going, i highly recommend letting the game run as you go do chores/work/errands and etc.  with more money in the bank you'll be able to explore more about the game.  in doing so, i have found out more things i dislike about this game:\n",
      "\n",
      "things that have aoe (area of effect) are pretty trash in this game right now.  there are certain conditions that need to be met in order to grow a high quality drug such as temperature and light.  you have basic uv lights, heaters, ac and etc.  you can also get upgrade these things like over head grow lights or large heaters but they pretty much suck/useless.  you'd think you'd be able to put overhead lights, well, overhead your plants.  you can't.  you figure that putting a large heater, right in front of your product would be sufficient enough.  wrong.  you put it at a specific angle that doesn't make any sense.  \n",
      "\n",
      "employees at your restaurants are constantly dropping things.  i've seen 3 year olds with iron like grips compared to these but wholes. i've once watched an employee pick up and drop the same burger 4 times in a row, leave it, then eventually come back before dropping it 2 more times. the worst part is, when they drop the food it becomes contaminated and will make customers sick who will eventually die (luckily there is no penalty for this...yet).  there is no way to get rid of the contaminated food.  you can't even put a garbage can in the kitchen for these but wholes to just throw it away.  \n",
      "\n",
      "employees also seem to have a mind of their own and will outright refuse to do tasks that you have told them to do.  for some reason, my employees really hate making glazed donuts, even though they are tasked to do it, and the glazed donuts have their very own station and dedicated fryer and they refuse to make it.  you can fire employees but  i really hope they eventually add in the ability to just kill off these useless employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "who also thought it was a great idea to make the burger fryer a special but-whole unit that must have a heater next to it or else it will explode?  if you do not maintain this thing with a heater (awkwardly placed, taking up valuable space) and maintenance man, it will explode and set your whole kitchen on fire.  \n",
      "\n",
      "game crashes at the weirdest times too.  \"oh, whats that?  you wanted to check on your employee's condition?\" crash. \"oh, you like saving because i'm in ea?\" crash. \"oh, that youtube video you were watching went into a commercial break?\" crash! (this literally happened last night to me).\n",
      "\n",
      "this is really tough for me.  i really do see the potential of this game and it's going to be fun, when it's fixed up, but it's current state is making me start to hate it.  i'm still sticking with my original review that this game is a big no.  i'll keep testing this product, for you and the devs, and will update when its working.\n",
      "great game in the making no complaints just know it is early access and accept it for that. 10/10 would buy.\n",
      "best game i played for years! we need more soon\n",
      "\n",
      "thanks\n",
      "this was a promissing early access game, with a great concept and art style. but unfortunately the execution is sub par! many bugs, unrefined ui. this should have more development before release!\n",
      "amazing visuals, cool concept, lot of fun\n",
      "after 15 hours im hungry for more!\n",
      "recommended if you love management games!\n",
      "good game, lots of fun\n",
      "drugs good\n",
      "build drug empire!\n",
      "encounter some bugs, mostly while trying to build.\n",
      "has a lot to offer for being ea.\n",
      "look forward to seeing everything the devs have to add.\n",
      "really hope the devs continue working on this game, so far it's been fun for early access.\n",
      "this game is very fun and much like the product we move, it is addictive. i am having a lot of fun figuring out the mechanics of the game and building my shops up. this game is ea but i think it has a lot of potential. it is very buggy at the moment but the dev is very responsive and tries to help you out when possible. this game also has longevity. i have logged 50 hours and i am still managing to find things to make the game fun.\n",
      "great game and im ten hours in and still loving it!!\n",
      "definitely not fried chicken is a great business management game. it needs some work, but functions good now. i'm a big fan of breaking bad so when i saw this coming out, i was really excited and i haven't been disappointed. many features are not available yet in the game because of early access, but you can still cook 4 types of drugs and run 3 businesses, a laundromat, a doughnut shop and a chicken shop. great game that has a lot of potential as long as they continue releasing content updates and bug fixes.\n",

      "the game has some work needed, but overall i think it's pretty good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "for the devs: the biggest problem i have with it at this point is that it needs a better system for distributing your wares.  the mopeds and cars are a great idea, but the problem is that it's pretty tedious and difficult to see at a glance what is happening logistically.  \n",
      "\n",
      "as an example, you get calls in the neighborhood requesting your goods.  you have to assign vehicles you own to take the goods to the location.  this is fine at first, but it quickly becomes obvious that there will be a lot of these requests and you'll have to be going into the dispatch screen to just tell your cars to go to a bunch of places.  i think this detracts from the game a good bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "also, there's not really a good way to distribute goods efficiently to the other businesses you own.  cars get sent to locations regardless of how full the local storage is, meaning they could just be sitting overnight (since inventory is static at night) and only keep doing the rounds late in the morning.  distribution could be automatic--stores request goods they want--or you could make a new job \"the dispatcher\" to handle those logistics.  either way, the logistics are not great.\n",
      "\n",
      "i think the limit on factory workers based on plots owned doesn't make a lot of sense and it's a little unbalanced.  at the current setting, i don't see a way to defend my factory and still produce.  maybe this was intentional since attacks don't yet seem to be a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "still some buggy things but overall, very nice little game.\n",
      "short and sweet:\n",
      "i absolutely love this game and its something i can see myself building upon for a while but in its current state of not loading saves with meth past 75% , i cant recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "any time i get to a point in my save where i start manufacturing meth, my save files wont load past 75%.\n",
      "this has happened twice and at the current time i don't feel like restarting again, i'm just super bummed.\n",
      "until they fix this error i cant recommend this game.  i don't know if the error is due to the fact i have the meth lab or the fact that by the time i get there my factories larger with more employees. more employees seems to make the game lag. i've left the game sitting for hours in hopes it'd load my save to no avail.\n",
      "cool concept and a great game, developers read and take attention to your feedback as well. in time this game will be a great game im sure of it\n",
      "its really  about the grind\n",
      "too many bugs for now, and not only a few. gamebreaking, too, very random. this feels more like (pre-) alpha and they have a lot of work ahead of them.\n",
      "i want to like this game and reccomend it, but in the current state i cannot do that.\n",
      "the first \"hotfix\" they released was also more or less a joke, since they are soo many bugs in the game reducing the fun and if you're lucky you can reload your save every few minutes to fix some things but not always.\n",

      "i must say, the game is beautiful, the music(relaxing-pop-disco-elecric-piano-esque) and art(3d pixels, the color palette is vibrant and game gives vibes of gta vice city) is so on point that i can go on for hours without noticing. the gameplay(very simplified yet unique tetris like construction with optimization and resource management) is so genuine and it satisfies my mild ocd. the game takes me to its whacky quirky world and makes me feel like a shady businessman.\n",

      "my name is walter hartwell white. i live at 308 negra arroyo lane, albuquerque, new mexico, 87104. this is my confession. if you're watching this tape, i'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law hank schrader. hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. shortly after my 50th birthday, hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. connections that he made through his career with the dea. i was... astounded, i... i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was... thrown, confused, but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. and i was weak. i didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed. every day, i think back at that moment with regret. i quickly realized that i was in way over my head, and hank had a partner, a man named gustavo fring, a businessman. hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when i tried to quit, fring threatened my family. i didn't know where to turn.\n",
      "eventually, hank and fring had a falling out. from what i can gather, hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. fring was able to arrange, uh i guess i guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but hank was seriously injured, and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. upon recovery, hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named hector salamanca, he plotted to kill fring, and did so. in fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. i have often contemplated suicide, but i'm a coward. i wanted to go to the police, but i was frightened. hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. for 3 months he kept them. my wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what i had done, why hank had taken our children. we were scared. i was in hell, i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family. recently, i tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. i can't take this anymore. i live in fear every day that hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. i... all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is\n",

      "\n",
      "i didn't even know they could make musou game that would genuinely be bad, as the genre itself is not really know for being complex when it comes to mechanics, but holy shit, this game is bad. \n",
      "how could they fuck up such a premise when there are two extella games that exist? all you had to do is to give us a musou game with servants. in the meantime you see comments like \"mommy musashi\" and \"jalter my beloved\", but you are playing musashi for a total of 15 minutes, and then jalter you play for like 15 seconds, only for a single section they let you control jeanne. this is fucked up. actually, no, this is beyond fucked up. i don't even care if that spoils the game to someone because i bought this game for the premise of playing as jalter because i thought they'll give you like a free mode type thing where you can replay encounters with anyone you want, but no, there is no such thing. don't be lured in by all the positive feedback. maybe they'll give you more servant gameplay through season pass, but have you seen the price for that shit?! doubt it'll be worth it. and if that means that you're playing more iori, then double no from me. game does look amazing, and i love the artstyle of it, but goddamn am i just empty after clearing it.\n",
      "also, three billion tutorials.\n",
      "\n",
      "your main gameplay loop is playing the weakest musou character they could come up with, iori. why is he the weakest? well cause everyone gets hyper armor whenever you are fighting as him. the only way to actually deal damage to anyone larger than you is to break their armor by countering or just waiting till their move is done and then time your strikes while their defence is \"lowered\". you wanna have fun and play a cool character, which is basically like any servant in the game? we got you. here's a bar that lasts ~20 seconds that you have to grind for 30 years as iori, and then maybe by divine intervention you can play a servant until you've just barely familiarized yourself with their movesets. people who played through the game will tell me \"but there are times when you play servants only\" and yeah, sure, that would be an argument if you could play them for more than 15 minutes of in-game time. but alas, this is not what fate game is about i guess. totally not. don't be fooled, you're not playing servants in this game for the most part. even ng+ is just that, it's same game but with your progress already being there. i'm disappointed beyond belief. i pre-ordered it because i dreamed of a musou game with servants, given extella was the only thing closest to that, so i had hopes when i saw koei making a fate game. beaten it because that's the only way i can justify spending money on this piece of shit. and even then it just left me with a bigger feeling of disappointment. cause the whole time i played, i was hoping that the game will allow me to just pick servants i wanna play as and ditch the stupid and weak iori. i just wanted a musou game with servants that's not riddled with stupid tile-conquering gameplay shtick and i couldn't even get that, unbelievable. \n",
      "do not buy this. just don't. maybe on sale 10 years later along with whatever content comes out for it later, but not full price. this is a huge flop and i hope that whoever is writing those positive reviews will wake up and see the game for what it is.\n",

      "- character designs have returned to that grounded fate/stay night and fate/zero style. this game is a breath of fresh air from the overly \"tropey and anime\" designs that fgo and fate/apocrypha started to introduce.\n",
      "- the cutscenes are fantastic. i feel like i'm watching unlimited blade works again for the first time when a fight scene is being shown.\n",
      "- character progression is easy to understand and meaningful. the moves you learn are flashy and fun to use. changing stances actually changes the way you play\n",
      "- enemy designs are either completely new or taken from fgo and given a nice makeover. if you remember the little onis from shimousa or the kintoki rider event, those make an appearance and they actually look creepy.\n",

      "- your servant is another saberface, which is a minor critique at best. her character design is changed enough that she definitely looks unique.\n",

      "the main warning i'd give is that, like the vn, there is a *lot* of reading. the game really revels in creating a distinct sense of place, and it benefits greatly from this. in much the same way you come to learn the streets of kamurocho in yakuza, you get similar vibes here, plus the historical aspect which is omnipresent.\n",

      "the story takes place in 17th-century japan during the keian uprising. you take the role of of iori miyamoto, disciple of the legendary miyamoto musashi. iori earns his living by doing odd jobs, following his code of honour to keep the peace. after a strange mark appears on the back of one of his hands, the young man finds himself unwillingly drawn into the waxing moon ritual. in a desperate situation, iori manages to summon a servant and confirm his participation in the ritual as master. saber is summoned...\n",
      "\n",
      "for a newcomer to the fate franchise, the beginning is usually difficult. even though fate has anime adaptations and one of the longest-running mobile games, it's still difficult to introduce a newcomer to the fate series without giving them a link to a 5k page wiki... nevertheless, it was difficult before fate/samurai remnant. the game gently introduces you to the fate universe, explaining absolutely everything you need to know to fight effectively in a holy grail war. i was surprised at how simply and effectively the game explained what are relatively difficult concepts!\n",
      "\n",
      "although fate/samurai remnant is essentially an action-rpg, it offers a long, detailed and complete story, a quality that lives up to the standards of the fate franchise. veteran fans of the franchise will find all the ingredients of a good type-moon title here. the story explains every element and rule of a holy grail war in detail, ensuring that those unfamiliar with the franchise will be able to follow the story smoothly and easily. once you've completed the game, you can start a new game to access an extended storyline, a modified ending and brand new scenes that give you even more information about the lore. a classic type-moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "of course, i can't talk about fate/samurai remnant without mentioning saber. ah, saber... i've lost count of the number of times my quest told me to go right when saber was on my left, gazing at a food stall... probably one of the most endearing characters in the entire fate series! the bond that develops between iori and saber is one of the highlights of the game. little by little, iori gets to know and understand saber. in exchange, saber will get used to iori's calm and peaceful character, while trying to understand how miyamoto musashi's student sees the world... the other characters won't leave you unmoved either. you'll quickly feel a sense of friendship for the rogue servants, while surprising yourself with compassion for the other master-servant duo, who all have their own stories to tell. you'll also be given a few lessons in history and mythology to help you understand the \"power\" of the true names of the servants!\n",
      "\n",
      "in terms of gameplay, it would be a bit reductive to say that this is a simple musou. while saber can wipe out weak enemies with a single blow, the bosses are... much more difficult. if you want to understand why i thought first of a \"inspired\" souls-like game, just play iori and turn the difficulty up to the max... the boss stages will be a real challenge! the different styles of iori's swords prevent repetition in battle and force you to rethink your strategy, as iori adapts his style to his opponents in order to win. i particularly liked the stark difference in power between iori and saber. you feel all the weakness of a simple, brave human and the monstrous power of a true heroic spirit! this difference is also felt when iori confronts a servant. without saber's help, it's hard to imagine musashi's adopted son winning... each servant has their own unique fighting style, so you'll enjoy trying them all!\n",
      "\n",
      "in conclusion, fate/samurai remnant is an excellent introduction to the fate series. beginners will discover all the basics of the universe while enjoying a story full of twists and turns and terribly engaging characters. as for confirmed fans, i'm not taking the slightest risk in saying that you'll find what you're looking for as a fate series fan in this title! this new type-moon x koei tecmo game is an unforgettable fate experience!\n",
      "for any non-fate fans wondering if you need to know anything about fate to play this:\n",
      "you don't have to know a single thing about the fate series to play this game. \n",
      "not only do they teach you how the war and history of the grail wars go, this is also a new installment in the fate franchise. completely tied to nothing else in any way\n",
      "\n",
      "now for my 7.5hr review:\n",
      "the beginning of the story is about how any other fate story would go, but now set in the edo period of japan.\n",
      "the masters are all very unique. so are the master's servants and rogue servants\n",
      "the gameplay has a lot going for it. from little mini-games like honing your blade and woodcarving to core gameplay mechanics having tag team systems and link attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "my main drawback from the game:\n",
      "like the fate/extella games, the controls on mouse and keyboard are atrocious. you have to play on controller to have a good experience. i hope one day this is something they actually try to care about rather than it feeling like an afterthought.\n",

      "as fan of fate for over a decade i can say this is probably their most dense game yet. even after 7+ hours im only in the beginning stage of ch.2 (still waiting on fate/extra record!!)\n",

      "\n",
      "thankfully, they managed to find an excellent balance with what they know and new mechanics. combos initially flow like those in a musou game, linear chains of light attacks followed with a heavy, but they inject a need to react and play off the opponents that is so often missing from their more typical fare.\n",
      "\n",
      "they also manage to make the player character feel strong and useful, while demonstrating the huge gulf that exists between masters and servants as far as their strength. you don't feel underpowered or useless, but you absolutely do need your servant to survive. enemies aren't like those in other omega force titles, they can take a beating and if you fail to stay on your toes, they will punish you and easily deplete your hp bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "strictly viewing this as a fate/ game, this is the best adaptation of a holy grail war in any non-visual novel game so far. it perfectly captures the delicate act of having to balance the facade of daily life while also uncovering the other masters, preparing for nightfall when the veil of secrecy is easier to maintain and all out servant vs servant combat can really take place. \n",
      "\n",
      "as far as the story they do retread some well-worn story beats, borrowing from tropes established in more than a few fate/ stories. it does make for an excellent introduction to the franchise for first timers though, and a entrenched fan will probably find it nostalgic.

      "the fate/ game we all needed.\n",
      "this game makes me question my sexuality\n",
      "this game takes zero risks. the gameplay is yet another musou game with a band-aid on it in a terrible attempt to pretend it is an action rpg in the musou engine that has made copy/paste trash but with whatever ip logo on the same game since the early 2000s. rather than make a real game or take any risks, all these companies pay this company to shit out another turd with a new name and the same copy paste animations and attacks and same terrible ai enemies with rocks for brains that have been there from the first game. the story hits all the same copy/paste of every other fate series game, insert saber, can't tell you her name, cute and charming so you like her, protagonist is boring self insert unlikable trash.\n",
      "\n",
      "i will be so happy when the fate series finally drops the horrible shitty musou developers and their horrible trash tier combat systems and ps2 style graphics. get it on sale for $20-30 at most. it's just another trash musou game with barely more mechanics, but a polished turd is still a turd. musou games are bottom tier effort cheap trash that even mobile phone games out class these days in gameplay. save your money and don't encourage them to keep going for cheap cash grabs like this. the day they drop the musou developers, is the day i start buying every fate game to release as i'm a huge fate fan and i want a decent game to buy and play, but they just won't give me one.\n",
      "\n",
      "this game serves as an excellent litmus test for which review companies or channels are lying to you. if anyone dares give this higher than a 7.0/10 then you know they are the most die hard fate fan to the point they are hallucinating a good game or they literally never touched a good game before in their life and are only comparing it to the cheapest worst anime knockoff games made. if you want a solid fate title, sadly, melty blood is still the only thing you have. melty blood is worth more than the 18th musou game with the fate logo slapped on it and the recreation of the same story but with minor tweaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "i want a good fate game as much as i want a saber arc anime from ufotable. fate is my favorite series and that is all the more why it is so infuriating to see cheap anime fan cash grabs rather than a game that does the series justice. if you are ok buying the 13th musou game that is absolutely no different from the last 23 they made, by all means, enjoy. but those with half decent taste in games will stay away. refunded, not worth even half what i paid for it.\n",
      "yes\n",
      "saber is cute and you're rewarded for petting the dogs and cats. goty.\n",
      "game was released in a buggy state. can't choose display language from within game and have to do it via launch options. cutscenes automatically being skipped. saves not working. this is bad even for koei tecmo.\n",
      "\n",
      "from what i've seen of the game so far the gameplay is meh. the starting town is like a ghost town. ya there are people walking around but when you get close they fade out like literal ghosts. even gta 3 more than 20 years ago had a better pedestrians.\n",
      "love the story so far, very pretty scenery and combat is fun!\n",
      "when i first loaded up the game my controller was not working but after a reload everything was working perfectly. to be honest i was scared for the game play from what i heard, but the combat is pretty nice and not as repetitive as i thought it would be (compared to hyrule warriors age of calamity). if i did have a complaint, it would be that there really is not a reason to use the main characters earth style compared to water style, but i'm only 2.6 hours in i guess. other than that the story is great, and i hope everyone else enjoys it too.\n",

      "\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "based on my initial impressions of the game, i'd say it's more or less following a more open version of the persona 5 strikers formula. it's really technically smooth too for me; haven't run into any crashes or anything like that. some occasional stutter while loading shaders but that goes away the more you play. i have heard about the cutscene skipping bug some people are experiencing; i really hope that omega force fixes it, since this game is pretty darn good at first shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "you got an open world with different zones to walk around and do missions in, you got some navigation that can be done with the help of your servant, dual techs, follow-up strikes, you can temporarily swap to your servant and fight as them for a while, you equip gear, learn spells that use consumables... it's pretty expansive, and has a lot of strong rpg elements that give each character a strong progression curve. the musou combat is on point, though i wish the battles were larger. i hope they get larger later in the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "i've seen some people liken the game to the rgg studios games as well; walking around town, doing small missions and favors and errands for people, and yeah i would say that's present but not really that oppressive. the point of the game is to ease you into the battles and get you used to these micro-encounters with 25-50 enemies at once, much like persona 5 strikers did.\n",
      "\n",
      "i think the main problem with this game though, for most people, is probably going to be that it's pretty niche for what it is; you have to really be a neutral-to-positive fan of both musou games and type moon, particularly fate, to really like this. if you are, then this will probably be one of your favorite games to come out this year; and you also probably don't need to be convinced by me to buy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "but, for the rest of the internet, i think it's probably worth waiting for a sale. this definitely isn't a game that you can use to get into fate; the story is a mimicry of the core beats of the original fate/stay night story, but it won't tell you about anything you'll see in the other big name fate franchises, instead being more of an isolated story that uses similar themes and ideas. it might be a game you can use to get into the musou genre, but because of its open world and rpg elements, it's very different from the more mission and campaign-based structure of the mainline dynasty warriors games, or even the earlier spinoff licensed titles like one piece: pirate warriors, berserk & the band of the hawk or hyrule warriors.\n",
      "\n",
      "the bottom line is, for fans this is exactly what they want, but for anyone who isn't already in on this type of game or franchise, there's nothing here that will blow your mind or turn you into a fan of either that couldn't be found in one of the games i mentioned earlier in this review. because of that, while i can easily recommend this to a certain type of person, if you're not really familiar with type moon or with the musou genre, i would wait for this one to go on sale before you experiment with it.\n",

      "i may like this series and there are some good elements, but honestly, my experience with fate/samurai remnant was just painful.\n",
      "\n",
      "[b]note: trimmed to fit steam, check video for full version![/b]\n",
      "\n",
      "[h2]combat[/h2]\n",
      "i will start with the good. for one, the core combat mechanics are actually pretty good, great even. you get a handful of stances to swap between and are actually encouraged to do so depending on your hp level, how many enemies you are fighting, and what stats you want to prioritize. it adds a good bit of depth to the otherwise mashfest that is musou-style gameplay. there is still a bit of mashing, but i liked the extra layers added here.\n",
      "\n",
      "[h2]gameplay loop & difficulty[/h2]\n",
      "it is just unfortunate that this combat is stuck with some incredibly repetitive and tedious mission design. the game literally opens with you helping a guy collect debts from random people around town. that’s how bad it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "when you are not running random errands as main story quests, you are dealing with this absolutely tedious turn-based board game style travel system. you have to travel between nodes to get to your destination and if you run into an enemy along the way, jump into a copy-paste arena to fight them in.\n",
      "\n",
      "and the enemies are copy-paste too. you will be fighting the same type of samurai and a handful of monsters the entire game. you occasionally get some new, interesting ones, but it just becomes tiring spamming buttons against the same enemies battle after battle. especially so given how this game manages its difficulty level: by simply raising enemy hp. bosses especially, since they get an extra armor meter that just takes forever to break before you actually do damage. it’s not like the bosses are even hard, just boring and time-consuming.\n",
      "\n",
      "[h2]story[/h2]\n",
      "the gameplay is only about half of the experience, maybe just 30-40% of it. the rest is visual novel style storytelling, which i honestly don’t mind as a vn fan, but not so when it is as wordy and full of fluff like it is here. for every actual cutscene, you get a full 30 minute dinner dialogue scene. one cool character reveal, and then an info dump where a character explains a simple concept to death as if i was five years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "it’s just frustrating. boring and frustrating. i know the fate franchise is full of lengthy stories, but i don’t recall ever being as bored with them as i was here. the pacing is just far too slow.\n",
      "\n",
      "[h2]performance / pc port[/h2]\n",
      "i had no issues playing at 4k 120fps, although it was a bit weird that the game is divided into performance and quality modes on pc, the latter of which listed a 60fps limit. the game still looked fine in performance mode - at least, for this developer’s standard - so i can’t say i minded all that much. there are a bunch of video settings to change too, so props to the devs for that instead of just leaving it as one slider as they have definitely done in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "[h2]overall[/h2]\n",
      "i cannot recommend fate/samurai remnant. there are obviously some good ideas here, especially with the combat mechanics, but the gameplay loop, the mission design, and the story full of filler really sour the experience. the fate/extella games may have their issues, but they are at least better than this.\n",

      "my hero ultra rumble is a free to play fightering battle royale based on the anime my hero academia. the game is okay, it's fun enough. 8 teams of 3 people match, which of course you don't need to stick together. the gameplay is okay and kind of confusing. there's too many buttons to keep track of, you have 6 abilities + items. and when multi  the huge glaring problem i have with the game is the micro-transactions and the multi of in-game currency. unlocking characters are through a slow level-up or a gacha loot box. i found 2 characters i liked playing, but they are days/weeks of non-stop griding games and i'm losing the will to play anymore playing characters i'm not having fun with anymore. at the end of the day, it's a free to play game, you literally don't lose anything to download and play it. it's fine.\n",
      "don't.\n",
      "no.... just no, this is terrible!\n",

      "game good. unlocking characters is a bit weird but you get used too it. honestly better than fortnite ngl.\n",
      "lots of misinformation in some of these negative reviews about battle passes and character unlocks, especially about characters like all might. bakugo, todoriki, tsuyu and all might are not on a battle pass. they're on a special license that never goes away, so you can take however long you like to unlock them.\n",
      "\n",
      "as for the game, it's decent considering it's a free battle royale. it's about what you'd expect. fun with friends, not anything mind blowing. at the very least the developers listen to feedback considering they buffed the license exp gain by quite a lot a day or two ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "tldr: decent enough considering it's free. it's fun with friends, but i personally wouldn't spend money on it.\n",
      "easily the greatest battlegrounds game i've ever played. so so incredibly much better than fortnite, pubg, apex, you fuckin name it dude. things have gotten to the point where i dream about this game, it's so damn good. out of five stars i'd give it a six. playing kaminari, deku, and all might is actually just euphoric to me and i look forward to it everyday. i licked car handles for an hour just to get sick so i could stay home from school and play this masterpiece of a game. if you're having even the slightest thoughts of getting this game, please do so. it will change your life for the better. i haven't left my room since release day and i've been playing 24/7.\n",
      "good.\n",
      "so, i did the math. in order to guarantee a new character in the horrible gacha shop it is... $335. aside from that, only 3 characters, lida kendo and kaminari, can be bought with tickets... which you get 1 for 100 duplicates in the gacha, 1 for 200, and the rest for 300. lastly you can spend about 1 1/2 hours per level in the special pass, which gives certain characters(listed on the pass) every few levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "tldr: another overly greedy waste of space battle royale. i don't mind free to plays being greedy to an extent but holy hell this is bad.\n",
      "i would rather put cockroaches up my ass and let them crawl out of my mouth for 10 hours straight and then puking and eating that puke 1million times than play this horible masterpiece of shit\n",
      "my friend who i play cs:go with said if i post a review on my hero ultra rumble and it gets 75 likes and 30 awards that he will buy me a rtx 3060 and 1 kilo of lemon . so im just gonna leave this here. help a brotha\n",

      "10/10. insane hype, graphics and everything. new game but i recommend since it's free and since it's new you can see how it progresses.\n",
      "this game is the worst fucking game i've ever had the displeasure of installing and playing\n",
      "the balancing is shit, the game just feels unfair. don't play this go play something good.\n",
      "i've lost every match i've played. call it a skill issue if you want. but this is a terrible game with horrible balancing and good luck unlocking characters. almost impossible the way they have it set up\n",
      "[h2] tl;dr it has promise, but in its current state i wouldn't recommend playing this for more than a few hours. [/h2]\n",
      "\n",
      "the assets [u]heavily[/u] borrow from the my hero fighting game, which are vibrant and fun (especially if you're a fan of the anime) meaning you can pick up one of the hero's / villains you love most in the show and use their iconic abilities. the skeleton/ framework of the game feels to me like a near copy of the naruto: shinobi striker game. so this is a mashup of those two [b] with all of the pro's and con's of both [/b].\n",
      "\n",
      "the abilities look and feel powerful for most characters, meaning you can hop back and forth between different characters and mess around with play styles. i've enjoyed the speed based characters the most (ochaco, froppy and ida) as they feel the most unique in using terrain to their advantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "although the abilities look wonderful in the cell shaded style they feel quite heavy and can take up a lot of the screen leading you to easily get yourself lost in a fight with another team. in addition. you'll find that if you've had your shield broken by two abilities/ attacks that you'll be getting knocked over constantly. the evade window works in a 1v1 setting, but, in this 3v3 game-mode dodging (using ctrl as default) feels absolutely pointless. \n",
      "\n",
      "menu-ing is atrocious, honestly some of the worst i've seen in a multiplayer game, it feels un-intuitive and screens are never as easy to access as you'd like. why can't you unlock characters in the shop, why do some menu icons feel like they need to be clicked twice to access and why is readying up in a small box to the left instead of underneath your character?\n",
      "\n",
      "monetisation what you can expect from a standard free-to-play gacha game. i've counted 4 main currencies as well as 3 others that unlock items in the \"gallery\"? horrible way to pad out timed challenges and battle passes. on top of this, [b] locking characters behind a paywall [/b] will inevitably lead to a toxic pay2win environment with some characters being stronger than others, regardless of skill. \n",
      "\n",
      "the devs have counteracted this by giving new users access to one character ticket to unlock whoever you'd like which is a good start, but i doubt it'll help the longevity of the game.  \n",
      "\n",
      "[h3] here's what i'd like to see improved [/h3]\n",
      "- abilities being on a decent cool down leading to fights needing to rely more on melee and the dodge mechanic\n",
      "- much simpler menu's \n",
      "- more game mode's (including solo and team based objectives)\n",
      "- revive's easier to collect (one ticket rather than three) but are more visible and longer to cast.\n",
      "- plus ultra having a kind of ultimate/ super attack as at the minute it feels lack luster\n",
      "- objectives other than box opening and rescuing \n",

      "if you are wondering whether or not this game is worthy of an install read this. the overall game play is very fluid. your objective is clear and how to accomplish it even clearer. there is a lootbox system to get free cosmetics and if you roll duplicates you get rewarded with another currency to buy more cosmetics. the only down side to this game i would have to say is the way you unlock characters such as froppy, bakugo, todoroki, mr. compress and all might. you have a separate leveling system aside from your account level and license level(bp). and it takes a very long time just to scrape from level 0 to 1. then it becomes a little easier and xp feels as if its coming in larger quantities. but other than that the way the game works, the mechanics, the characters and the cosmetics are 10/10. i suggest installing it if you are a first-timer and try playing about 10 games of unranked. oh right! there is also a ranked mode for those competitive souls among us! you get to climb through the ranks of beginner, amateur, pro, and ace. but anyways. install the game. get your cosmetics and play about 10 games to really get a feel for it. i recommend it all the way. at the time of writing this i have about 30 hours in the game.\n",

      "nah\n",
      "\n",
      "this game lacks cross-play, feels somewhat unbalanced, and can be hard to follow as moves will come out very quickly from any direction and you can be combo'd by projectile attacks preventing you from being able to fight back or run away to heal. if the game continues to update it could become a solid game but it need more time to cook.\n",

      "instead of guns you rely on your character and class ability and attempt to snipe or rush down your enemies, battles can last anywhere up to 3 seconds or 3 mins depending on the enemies adaptability, there's alot of unique aspects each character brings such as flight, grappling dashing up walls and more.\n",

      "not having every single character unlocked goes hard cause it forces you to play people you wouldn't normally play and be pleasantly surprised at how fun everyone is, otherwise i would've just played 1 char and never looked back.\n",

      "\n",
      "the grind is really not that bad. i got toga, compress, gundam speed boy, bakugo, and vine girl within 12 hours of play. the game gives you a lot of crystals at the start that you can dump into leveling up the special licence which really helps out. they give you 4 free ten pulls at the start. and if you create a agency or join one. you can level up your gym and get crazyyyy exp boosts that also help with leveling your special licence to unlock characters faster. i am already at level 32 and have cleared most of the event rewards, completed all the weekly, etc. 2 - 3 games a day finishes all your dailies. and yes, you can also test out characters you want to play before unlocking them. a lot of the free choices are really nice. especially dabi who i have won countless games with now. its not that bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "negatives:\n",
      "\n",

      "- lower the pity rate. 200 pulls for a pity is rough when the diamond rate is so terribly low and most people, like me, use those beginner diamonds to level up their special licence to unlock meta characters instead of wasting them on a banner with 3 mediocre characters. put it at 100. \n",
      "- can't bend over emote with mount lady in giant form. smh\n",
      "- player base on pc is dwindling. the first day, it was really fast to find and play a match. now it takes at least 10 minutes to load in. compress your servers. having too many is causing the connection errors we are having and the maintenance from yesterday. too many is making things take too long and breaking shit.\n",
      "- maps are really small and the circle moves way too fast. increase the map size, make new maps, or at least cut the time on the circle by at least 30%.\n",
      "\n",
      "but at the end of the day, the game has only been out for 2 days. its really fun for what it is. stick with it and i am sure it'll get better.\n",
      "i expected this to be terrible but it was surprisingly very fun, play it with friends.\n",
      "first of all, the cons. the characters are way too hard to get, although there are trial cards, it takes too long to refill and its only up till 3. the gacha system is slightly messed up, needing 200 points for a guaranteed character. the only way to get a character right now, (apart from the free character ticket they give you) is through the special license. it takes quite a few games to grind, but its better then nothing. also why are skins so much more common? i got both the dabi and the shigaraki event skin in one ten pull, but no characters. onto the good points of the game.\n",
      "the good (and some bad): combat feels fun, movement is janky, certain characters feel stronger then others. for example, ochako has both a grapple and a aoe cc that has two hits (if she sends it down) she also has a melee spinning attack, and she ends it by throwing it. her kit is overloaded with all sides having good coverage. compare this to iida.(i am a iida main and am slightly biased.) the \"speed\" he is supposed to be having feels lackluster, and the engine jam happens way too quick, the only half decent thing in his kit is his q, which deals really good damage. point is, the characters in this game dont feel balanced, and games are no strangers to unbalanced characters, and it only just launched so hopefully it gets fixed. also i hope no fill comes, i hate the need to wait for teammates to join, then they take 10 mins to ready then they leave anyway. also server issues, i was trying out all might,(with the trial card.) i plus ultra'd and they kicked me out. i wasted the card. so far tho the game is pretty fun with friends, characters with melee quirk a's, notably kirishima and iida(again) feels so unfun to play into a todoroki or a bakugo. they dont teach you that the character cards u pick up(the usable items) level up your quirks if you find your respective class. (eg: deku is assault. he finds all might card. his quirk level up.) \n",
      "rating.: coming from apex, this game is competitive, just needs to fix the character unlock system, gacha rates, balance out some characters. the outplay potential isnt really there, as most combos end with just one skill so it feels very limited with the skill expression. let me hit the naraka combos pls. 7/10.\n",
      "fun game unlocking some heroes are pretty confusing but solid game.\n",

      "\n",
      "character unlocks - though 3 of the characters are unlocked via rolling, the better characters are unlocked in the special license tab, which is completely free, though it's seems abit long, most games will give 4-5k points if you play well, deku is the starter character and is one of the best, and the first 2 unlocks within this tab are the most powerful. from rolling you can get 3 characters, they're all great but easily replaceable by their early game counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "visuals - wasn't expecting alot since this game was built up from used assests, but for a f2p game, it looks quite good, some of the animations can be wonky but i can't complain. hopefully they'll add a new map for rotation sometime in the future since the current one can get quite repetitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "gameplay - very team-based, it's nearly impossible to beat a team of 3 without your own team, the role system is something that i could still try messing with more due to the effects stacking, such as +3 rapid buffs. the spawning system isn't bad and i like the simplicity of it, could do with a ground format for inner structures instead of spawning through holes. the looting is nearly perfect in my opinion, and the mega boxes that drop are definitely a game changer, i wish there was a bonus for when you picked up your own character's ability card, like an extra upgrade, but i can't complain. zones are a staple in every battle royal and this game does them decently well, and i can imagine some future characters interacting with it in some ways that are unique. i think the down state is done well, and they clearly thought about the team focus alot more then other battle royals, the abilities linked to reviving are a good idea but the it's not really unique, all of them involve a barrier covering the enemy or moving them, i'd like to see a revive where it restores shield or upgrades abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "combat - most of the time, i forget i have a basic combo string. you always have a move off cd, and in the later games, why would you do a basic combo when you have 3 maxed out abilities to spam? and there's barely any benefit to comboing since barely any characters have combo string, best example being lida, but even then his combos are wonky and barely work. the current meta characters are all strong due to their strong range spam moves, like deku and bakugo which decreases the usability of characters with no way to fight them, kendo has been redundant since her release due to her lack of range and her almost useless special ability, i do think the combat is fun, just not fair.\n",

      "as for the battle royale part, it is far from better. the map is extremely small, and a couple of characters are able to hit you from a pretty good distance making some of the cast much better than others (bakugo). also, the down mechanics are kinda clunky. now this might be a bit of a skill issue, as i might have missed an item, but sometimes people get rezzed without anything or anyone being near them. for example, i was fighting a team and knocked down 1. the other 2 were on me and all of a sudden, the guy that was knocked out comes back to fight me. how he could come back still eludes me.\n",
      "lastly, the balancing of this game seems all over the place, as some characters feel wildly overpowered compared to others. while some have no movement abilities or range, bakugo has one of the highest ranged attack with a very high amount of damage and 2 movement abilities, which makes fighting him extremely unfair. this is only one example of questionable balancing.\n",

      "there aren't many game modes, matches are too short in my opinion and the game rewards aggression way to much, the servers are bad and the concept of locking any characters behind gacha is predatory and needs to be changed. but besides that it's a lot of fun, the core gameplay is good, the art style is good, most of the stuff is good and the game has a lot of potential. now whether they'll be able to fix any of the problems is another question entirely. \n",

      "i'd recommend most people just wait and see.\n",

      "it's nearly impossible to find a single revive card throughout the match.\n",
      "the rolls and pt feature to unlock new players is tedious and very expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "pros\n",
      "looks good and i enjoy the combat system.\n",
      "there's an exp system you earn each match that can unlock new characters faster.\n",
      "it's a very unique br with no guns which is refreshing. \n",
      "the matches are very challenging so it keeps me engaged and interested. \n",
      "\n",
      "overall an awesome game, i have my critiques but other than the revival cards my criticisms don't affect the actual game play. people are leaving bad reviews over the expensive point system to unlock characters, but the game is free and the devs need to profit somehow so i get it. you can get points slowly through a lot of game play if you do not wish to pay anything, there's also an experience point system that allows you to unlock characters faster.\n",
      "i thought it would be bad but not this bad shit...\n",
      "theres like 20 different currencies and to unlock most characters you either need to pay money or play for like a month\n",
      "played this game for 2hr on steam, 2hr on switch and 9hr on xbox and i noticed something that it feels wrong, you can't account sync in between platforms ;-;\n",
      "i have grind for the same skin 3 times because there is no account sync in between platforms even if you linked your bandai namco id, you cant even played the same account you last played on,\n",
      " i think we need a account sync feature if you link your bandai namco id so we can enjoy our stuff we got on playstation, xbox, switch and steam because it's a big in the ass to grind 3 different accounts on 3 separate platform despise being on the same bandai namco id\n",
      "funny\n",
      "the game is wank. \n",
      "\n",
      "mount lady can ult 30 times a fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "team mates run from every team fight, toooo many invincibility frames. it feels like being caught in a combo on shinobi striker, the game. too many hits dont make contact, however you can get hit whenever your fighting, the games trash\n",
      "gameplay good but that menu def needs some polishing\n",
      "the game is kind of glitchy and connection errors often happen, but the devs seem to be dealing with it. other than that, after seeing the gameplay from the tutorial, i'm already liking it.\n",
      "goated\n",
      "is it crossplay????\n",
      "the game is still needed for more updates. i guess you could play it now and think of it as an obt game it's looks pretty fun, but i feel like the server wasn't well prepared enough for global launch.\n",
      "no.\n",
      "w game, let it cook\n",
      "i broke it already (add crossplay)\n",
      "ochaco boob physics 10/10\n",
      "the tutorial was ok, but you can't really play after that because the servers are kaka.\n",
      "feels like mobile game, that's not even doing it justice.\n",
      "unlocking characters is a totally free system. most of which are found in the licenses tab. flip the toggle to the left of the points bar where it says special. all you have to do is earn xp. there are no xp boosters. the only currency you need is time. bold print so everyone can see it. 18 total characters with only 3 currently locked behind a timegated rng system.\n",
      "\n",
      "the worse part of this game is that it's many screens you can toggle between aren't very intuitive. there are a ton of help tip screens but they aren't perfect which is ok. also this game and it's devs failed to explain how to unlock characters which is what 80% of the bad reviews are about. other than that it's a cute little game with only 1 map to play on and the balancing is shockingly pretty fair. also if you're an anti anime consumer like me don't worry you're safe to play. this game doesn't do that thing and things we hate, i promise(after you beat the tutorial).\n",

      "cant play the game no thank you\n",
      "has real potential but needs a lot of work. controls are clunky at best, hit boxes dont always register and are all over the place, some characters attacks can stretch the whole map, you get hit once your stun locked and set up for an immediate ko by your opponent. the combat needs a rework maybe a parry or a variety of basic attack combos. characters also need more costumes to unlock the ones in the game right now feel dull and boring. all in all i give this game a 4.5/10 needs work but has potential\n",
      "takes 10 minutes to get in a game for some reason\n",
      "this is just shit. endless loading\n",

      "one thing i dislike alot and people have already been talking about is the unlocking of characters. it's locked behind gacha which is a really bad move from the devs. i don't get why they did this, imagine playing fortnite but in order to use the new assault rifle or pistol you have to roll on a banner in which it has a 1% drop chance. if you're unlucky you're stuck using the same weapon you've used from whenever you've started playing the game but in this case it's possibly your favorite character from the anime which sucks even more if you don't get it. i personally think that if they don't change this system or atleast add some other way of getting the characters which is more user friendly (like for example getting a currency by playing the game and with that currency you can unlock the characters, like every single other game on the market), the game will die really fast and i really don't want that since i think the gameplay itself is fun.\n",
      "really fun, slightly predatory microtransactions but it doesnt seem as bad as most say, characters arent in the battlepass, they're in the special pass, key difference is the special pass is not time limited and from what i can tell, and i will update when i know for sure, its also free, it just takes time to unlock some of the later characters like blood mommy and all might.\n",

      "- ridiculous censoring in text chat when the source material uses worst. really. the word/non-word \"uhoh\" you can't say. it makes it even more confusing when characters like dabi will say \"damn it\" when hurt or in a fight, yet you can't say it in the text chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "overall, it's not a bad game and it's free so it's worth a try at least. when you start the game it will load you down with in game currency and ticket pulls (the games version of loot boxes), however this is very common for gatcha games to get you in the door so i'm not really counting that as a plus for the game as much as i appreciate it. the downside is some of these characters are locked behind the gatcha system and the odds of getting them are around 0.5% each. some people have brought up balancing issues, however once you learn each characters play style it's not as unbalanced as it's made out to be. some characters excel in close range, others long range. i can see the developers intention of working with your teammates to pick up the weaknesses of each other however as stated previously, communication is almost impossible due to the bad voice chat system in the game so it makes this almost impossible to do with randoms.\n",

      "edit: i do see a lot of people bringing up the monetization and at the end of the day, you need to pick your poison. one's justice one and two both died very, very quickly as you had to pay for the game and anime based games aren't very popular in the first place so it makes sense why this game would be a free to play. granted, i do wish there was a 60 dollar dlc option to just buy everything in the game, however the game still needs to make money somehow while still being available for a lot of people to play to keep it alive. this may be me speaking from a place of good luck but i haven't spent a penny on the game and so far i've been able to get creati, vine, the shigaraki coat outfit and upgrade to the premium pass all through just playing the game and getting the in game currency. from my perspective and keep in mind this is just me, you do not need to drop a bunch of money for stuff like you would need to in a game like genshin impact or honkai.\n",

      "genuinely a disgusting spit in the face to gamer and anime fans. a pvp game were you must gatcha for characters, with most not even unlock able and requiring a \"rental ticket\" to use for a single match (you can only hold three at a time and get three from the tutorial) this game has a pity system that makes genshin look like a charity, for only 200 pulls you can get to choose the character you want. 200. to put that into perspective that would be 12,000 hero crystals (the in game premium currency) for 10 pulls, of which hero crystal pack c for 13,000 of them is $25. the fact is even when your favorite character actually becomes available for you to own without gambling hundreds of dollars or renting every match, it will cost you 300 duplicate items from the gatcha system to get one ticket to pick a character available. currently the game has a roster of 18 characters, with only 6 available to start with, 3 for tickets, three for gatcha, and fan favorites like bakugo, todoroki, asui, and toga as part of almost half the roster completely unavailable outside renting. btw the gatcha is 99% cosmetics and will give you them for character that you literally can't own for anywhere for 2-? months from release. the quality of life is that of a skid row encampment, they even have multiple lines of text for profile customization that are translated below the japanese text before equipping yet are only available in japanese the gameplay is as fun as it is basic, and yet the bots are incapable of even healing themselves as your teammates although they have 3 different tiers of bot only matches. this game is what happens when you have a company have an open casket funeral for a dead horse that was beaten at the morgue for 2 weeks straight, force everyone to take a bite of the rotten body, and then charge them $100 for each sip of water to wash it down after the soul binding contact to enter. wouldn't be shocked if it had data breaching malware and knowing now these people are making the jujustu kaisen game that i actually care about has removed a couple months worth of serotonin from my world that no amount of kiwis can replenish. if someone with almost 2000 hours in destiny 2 can call this a brain dead life wasting scam its clearly not worth the 4 gb it demands. do yourself a favor and go to a casino and roll machines all night if you want to play this game, its a lot less saddening to experience and 100% less embarrassing then having this on your account...\n",

      "alright so to start off this review i first want to say this game is in no way finished. even with that said i still have a good time playing this, even with randoms. it's of course not the best battle royale title, but it definitely has it's perks. i noticed a couple people complained about some of the hero's/villains being locked behind loot boxes which yes i can see that being an issue, but it gives the player reason to play a goal if you will outside of just winning. (you can get loot box's for free btw just need to play quite a bit) outside of loot boxes you can slowly unlock quite a bit of characters for just playing. for example you unlock bakugo once you reach lvl 2 in the season. honestly though i would stop playing this game in like a week if i had every character given to me. i just think it's nice to main one hero/villain and then we you finally get a new hero it's a entire new experience . all in all i really like this game as of right now, and if the developers update this game right it will just get better from here. so for my final review i would give this game a 7/10 in the battle royale genre! \n",

      "pretty fun and enjoyable,  but i prefer playing en passant in chess\n",
      "genuinely i cant say positive or negative for this game. really cool concept, done probably as best as it could be. but it falls victim to the normal things that bring a game like this down. it feels like a high end phone game that got a little too overdeveloped for phones. so many things hidden away behind lootbox style pay walls. not to mention the plague that comes from battle royale games, where its so unforgiving to newer players that trying to learn takes longer than it takes to decide if you like the game so by the time i finally figured out what i was doing the game already seemed incredibly repetitive and unbalanced. without fail you will get stunlocked until your downed and there is nothing you can do about it\n",

      "4. roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n",
      "5. pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n",
      "6. bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. reduce heat to 350 degrees f (175 degrees c), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. allow to cool completely before slicing.\n",

      "now. characters unlocked via gacha is scummy especially since they have .0533% chance of being unboxxed. however, i feel as if the special pass is scummier. 30,000xp per tier out of 30 total tiers. you get roughly 2k xp on a win and anywhere from 200-800 if you place lower. bakugou is on tier 2, todoroki 3, tsuyu 7, compress 12(iirc), toga 15, and all might is at 30. which means if you want all might. you need to win minimum 450 matches. that level of grinding is absurd. if you wanted to buy your way to all might, it is seventy seven dollars! so if you download this wanting to play any of those characters. tough. play the hell out of the game or shell out money. also why add 3 different ways of unlocking characters? theyre randomly chosen as well. why is denki/iida/kendo stuck behind a completely different system than the special pass/gacha???? the only way you can get character tickets is through red souls which are obtained by unboxxing duplicates in the gacha system. why???? double also. this game will live or die by crossplay and it is not here. in 2023. byking. if you truly want this game to succeed. fix these issues asap!!\n",

      "this is coming from someone who hasn't really been invested in my hero for quite awhile now, probably about 4 years? so take that into consideration as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "the game itself is... alright. it's a battle royale, but with fun superpowers. the controls are a little jank, but i'm sure with time you could adjust to them because they're not unplayably bad. it's super fast paced, which can make it a little difficult to try and pay attention to what's happening, and where you're being attacked from. most of my experience is from apex, which when i last played was pretty similar to this. less intensive on the computer though, so there's that plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "the main, glaring issue, is the gacha system. it blows absolute chunks. it has a horrible pity system, where with 200 rolls you can guarantee yourself one of the 3 characters in the current loot rolls. i didn't do the exact math, but from eyeballing it would definitely be more than $100 for one character if you got extremely unlucky. which, given that the loot tables show that each item that you can pull has a less than 1% chance to even be pulled, you probably won't get the character you want.\n",
      "and to unlock characters, from what me and my friend could figure out (which took way too long, the currencies and how to unlock stuff isn't explained well at all) you need hero tickets, which you can get for 100 souls. only once, mind you. then you can get one ticket for 200 souls. then from that point on all tickets will be 300 souls. what are souls? duplicates from pulls on the gacha. you /might/ be able to get a handful from missions or the battle pass, but i wouldn't count on it.\n",
      "but as you read yes- on top of a gacha with a horrible pity system, there is a battle pass. the free one, i will say is quite generous compared to most free tracks, but you don't get a lot of exp per game to level it. so to get the characters locked behind that as well, expect to grind a hell of a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "now, gachas are pretty normal in f2p games in the past few years, and i understand some people don't mind them as much. if it was solely cosmetic, i really wouldn't mind them, but they do end up being pretty predatory no matter what. it's especially worse when whole characters, in a pvp game, are locked behind luck based pulls. and not all of the characters are created equal, either. it's almost similar to the overwatch 2 situation, where there is competitive modes locked behind gacha and pass mechanics. hell, even a game like pokemon unite pulls it off better than this game does.\n",
      "\n",
      "there isn't even an option to purchase them out right with real money, which is really a shame. i totally would've put a few bucks in to be able to play as my fave character, kirishima, but he's locked behind the gacha for this time around. probably would've come back to it from time to time, because the quirks do make combat interesting, but you're given 1 free hero ticket at the time of this review, and 3 sort of \"trial\" tickets, where you can try out 3 different heroes, or the same hero 3 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "if you really like my hero, and have the money to blow for the stuff you want, then sure go for it. but if there's just one or two characters you wanna play, i'm sure the fighting game they made would probably be better suited. \n",

      "tl;dr:\n",
      "mid game, insane amounts of gacha and battle pass microtransactions, has potential to be fun but characters that are better than others being locked behind paywalls is a horrible way to do shit and sours most of the experience\n",

      "\n",
      "- you can't unlock characters directly, you only get 3 free game per day with locked characters, if you want to unlock them permanently, you have to spend points you get when using a roll which is basically a loot-box.\n",
      "i've used about 20 rolls and i managed to get 48 points, a character costs 200 points.\n",
      "my guess is that the free characters are going to change each day or week but it's frustrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "- the fighting mechanic is very confusing, we know the anime is full of special effects every time a character attacks which they recreated here. i get that they wanted to keep the fighting style of the source material which is fine when 2 or 3 people are fighting but when you get 10 heroes or villains fighting at the same place it gets really chaotic.\n",
      "\n",
      "- there's only one map and it is very tiny\n",
      "\n",
      "- the items you get for free or those in the shop have no description, i bought a character ticket thinking i'd be able to unlock a hero but it doesn't seem to work that way and i still haven't figured out what it does lol\n",
      "\n",
      "- leveling up your hero agency (which is basically a guild) takes ages, i did about 10 games and the progress bar barely moved\n",
      "\n",
      "the positive:\n",
      "\n",
      "- the aesthetic of the anime is there, same for the sound effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "- the character models are really well made and have fun costumes. not a lot as per now but i'm sure they'll add more in the future\n",
      "\n",
      "- speaking about costumes, you can easily unlock a lot of them. yes, it is a loot-box system but even if you get doubles, you get currency you can spend in the shop. also, there's a special type of costume which has different colors of auras.\n",
      "every time you get doubles of one of those, you get access to a new aura color that you can use to customize this said outfit.\n",
      "\n",
      "- the gameplay is simple yet varied enough to turn the tied of the battle to your advantage when the right strategy is used. that is if you manage to understand what is happening on screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "[*] some characters are locked behind a \"special\" battle pass that takes way too long to grind to permanently unlock characters\n",

      "[*] (did i forget to mention that apparently those hero licenses you use reset every season...? why? who knows. for some reason, you can't use licenses on specific characters, like those in the gacha and those in the special pass...\n",

      "i do also like how getting the same gacha costume rewards you with an aura that gets upgraded for the skin with each copy, leading up to a rainbow aura, thats neat (if the auras worked ingame!).\n",
      "\n",
      "[b] but [/b] hear me out: other than that, the game is really enjoyable! i've been waiting to replay the game since the beta and its been a blast to play, even solo! leveling up is simple, and combat is decent, the only nitpicks i have is when an entire team is down, you can all still self res (and most of the time, one of you will get up if they loose track of all of you in a fight as some characters take way too long to finish downed players.), downing players don't count as your ko still, the person that executes them gets the kill...?, and some characters are still just as busted as ever. for example, mt. lady's enlarge is still way too tanky for its own good, making 1v1 fights and 1v2 fights downright unfair in final zones with nothing you can really do but to hope you can find cover somewhere.\n",

      "the gameplay is a mess. combat feels clunky and unresponsive, with poorly designed controls that make you want to throw your controller across the room in frustration. the hit detection is laughable, and the ai is so brain-dead that you'll wonder if you're playing against a bunch of cardboard cutouts. the game's mechanics are convoluted and poorly explained, leaving you to figure things out through trial and error.\n",
      "\n",
      "the story is an afterthought, with a plot so generic and uninspired that it's forgettable within minutes. the voice acting is equally forgettable, with characters delivering their lines in a monotonous, emotionless fashion that drains any potential for immersion.\n",
      "\n",
      "but perhaps the biggest insult is the microtransactions. my hero ultra rumble shamelessly bombards you with in-game purchases at every turn. want a new character? pay up. want a cool costume? pay up. it's a blatant cash grab that preys on unsuspecting players.\n",

      "not bad\n",
      "cant buy characters lmao. yeah im good chief. game is maybe alright but no where near a great br. worse than literally every br ive played with melee attacks as well as gunfire. play naraka/apex/rumbleverse literally any other br. couldve been good if not for scummy practices tbh.\n",

      "at the moment i really like it, the gameplay is fun and it doesn't feel like the usual battle royale, if they keep it alive with new heroes, events and maps it could be a really good game, the gacha system seems quite generous for now and i love the animations and the feel of the combat system.\n",
      "you can unlock permanently all the characters, some with the gacha and some with the hero tickets that can be got through the missions, but you can try every hero/villain for free 3 times per day, and that's really cool if you want to test it out before unlocking it.\n",

      "\n",
      "the only real downside to this game is no crossplay. a my hero battle royal is already niche enough, so i dont know if it will be able to maintain a good player count. this can be an upside though for some pc players as console aim assist is horrendous.\n",
      "\n",
      "overall though first impressions are good.\n",

      "\n",
      "some of the characters are also only obtainable through the battle pass, such as all might being locked at the highest level of the battle pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "there are several different types of currencies which can be overwhelming.\n",
      "\n",
      "my first instinct after the tutorial: check out the shop to see if heroes are currency locked, but i didn't find the heroes there, immediately checked on google how to unlock them, as you cannot buy them outright it seems. it was strangely confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "if you're planning to spend money on a small-scale battle royale game and are a big fan of mha that you don't mind shelling out some cash for costumes and characters, dive in! otherwise i would say hard pass, as other brs are much better and more consumer-friendly than this one.\n",
      "this game is dogshit <3\n",
      "janky as hell, awful ui, feels like a mobile game, and the lack of cross play for a battle royale in 2023 is an absolute deal breaker. waste of time.\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Good Game [/h1]\\n\\nI finished this game in around six hours. I really enjoyed the art style. The animations, strange worlds and bosses were all nice to look at. The game has really simple gameplay consisting mostly of activating different devices in a certain order to get to the next area. The central mechanic was interesting(traveling in and out of different orbs to solve puzzles), unfortunately the puzzles only truly got me to think about them a few times and were never very difficult to figure out. i wish the game had focused a bit more on creating more complex or interesting puzzles to use the games central mechanic. maybe having optional side areas with more difficult puzzles could have provided a better challenge to someone like me that plays a lot of puzzle games\\n\\nThe central mechanic in this game reminds me of another puzzle game i have played Patricks Parabox, in comparison Cocoon feels more like style over substance. Patricks parabox in compaarison is much uglier but has much better designed puzzles using a similar central mechanic to cocoon but uses it much better by focusing solely on the puzzles and continuously added more and more complicated puzzles. Maybe if cocoon has spent a bit more time on the puzzles instead of the art styles it may have been more engaging. The final puzzle in cocoon is underwhelming because it is so easy. if the game had built on the challenge better and ended with a unique and challenging puzzle it would have left a much bigger impact on me\\n\\ni recommend if you think you would enjoy a pretty game with simple to novice puzzles. Might be great for you if you want a short pretty and simple experience',\n",

       "  'review': \"Beautiful yet short puzzle game by brilliant Jeppe Carlsen (of INSIDE fame). Every aspect of the game is polished and satisfying:\\n- The music elevates tension, guides the player and rewards when taking the right path/solving puzzles. \\n- The art style is a mesmerizing bio-mechanical and at times Escher-esque, all the while sneaking peeks of a vast unobtainable world. \\n- The puzzle design is simple and ramps up in complexity as the game progresses, I was was stumped for a while on one or two puzzles but on the whole felt it was mostly straightforward and easily understandable. I guess I would have liked some harder or more mind bending puzzles (though I am a fan of puzzle games and played quite a lot of them)\\n- As I've mentioned, the game is pretty short - finished it completely (including all achievements) in under 5 hours. On the one hand I fell like I would've liked more, yet on the other hand it was a very concentrated and curated experience. This is the only part where if you are not a fanatic of Carlsen's or of puzzle games might want to consider if the price to game to time ratio is enough for you. In my opinion it is very much worth my money.\\nA uniquely gorgeous experience, one that at least on the puzzle side is very close to portal, and transports you to an artfully imaginative world. Can't wait to see what Carlsen and his team create next!\",\n",

I only really had to think hard in the last 30mins or so, but that again is no real complaint. I suppose you could be critical that it follows the abstract-alien-puzzle-wordless setting thats is fairly common for these sort of games.. But it does it so well that I can forgive it!

       "  'review': \"I tumbled through COCOON in most of an evening and the early hours of the next morning, finishing the game in just under the 6 hour mark, compelled forwards by one of the most intriguing videogame worlds I've explored in a while. Before we get started: if I see a single complaint about this game being 'too short for the price', I'm going to explode; COCOON, like few other games, maximises every minute to show you something new, and reminds us what games can be when we take the risk to pursue the original.\\n\\nCOCOON reminds me of a number of games: the wide-eyed wonder and revelations of Outer Wilds, the pick-up-and-put-down trial-and-error puzzling of Wind Waker's later dungeons, the alien environment of... well, it's hard to pick just one, as COCOON journeys you through the macro and the micro, stretching your mind like taffy to comprehend where and when you might be. Without the strong environmental and art design holding it together, you'd get whiplash, but as it stands, worlds which begin novel become familiar over time - which, as it turns out, is key to the gameplay.\\n\\nThe puzzling premise, here, is diving in and out of glass orbs, each of which contains a world. To keep it as spoiler-free as possible, you soon discover these glass orbs are the core of your puzzling power, as well as the road your journey takes place on. Just as you feel you've discovered the limit of how they can be used, COCOON nudges you a little further, encouraging you to take that mental leap of faith to find a new path forwards.\\n\\nAnd it really is that - a polite nudge. At no point did I feel like I was headbutting a brick wall in my puzzle-solving. I'm an impatient puzzler, and struggle to get my head around layered puzzles, but COCOON is kind, ensuring I understood the bounds of each puzzle by limiting my area of play, and nearly all frustration is allayed by the feeling that the game wouldn't play tricks on me, or bait me with red herrings. I dislike puzzles of this sort, so if you do, too, you'll hopefully find COCOON is a good balance of puzzle versus progress.\\n\\nThere are some brief moments of true frustration, though. For instance, one series of solutions relied heavily on timing, which felt mildly incongruous with the puzzles up until that point. But it wasn't by any means enough to shatter my immersion: and what a world to be immersed in. \\n\\nCOCOON is minimalist. A 5-key control system has you absorbed within moments, the need to learn complex key-binds eliminated. COCOON toys with scale, colour, flora and fauna, perspective, shape, so on and so forth, to communicate lore in what is otherwise a wordless, speechless game, and it's at its best for it. \\n\\nCOCOON knows exactly what it is, does that extremely well, and leaves you as a player wondering what on earth - or not, as the case may be - you just experienced as you surface for air at its completion.\\n\\nIt's very good.\",\n",

Honestly want more and tougher puzzles (think they could've done a few more big ones at the end), these are pretty easy, but for a chill puzzle game with cool mechanics and honestly some REALLY good animation and art direction, a great time, it has a short, interesting story, not much of it I guess, which is fine, usually puzzle games struggle with that, although the end intrigues me for sure, hopefully a cocoon 2 eventually! Achievements were pretty easy as well. Oh also a small criticism is that it feels like it's going to be more open world but it is very linear, which is 100% fine, I just kept thinking there would be like a hub world with 4 different directions to go, but that wouldn't really work with what this game is trying to do. 9.5/10\",\n",

Annapurna Interactive sure knows how to pick who and what to publish because this game deserves all of the love that its getting. \\n\\nThere is legitimately not a single part of this game that I can knock. I don\\'t dislike any part of it and thats coming from someone that DESPISES puzzles and puzzle games. The puzzle design and general gameplay felt very good, forcing me to think outside the box a good bit but still very much playing within its own ruleset. \\n\\nThe best part of this game though is not the gameplay but the presentation, art direction and music all working in harmony. If you are a little wary that the trailers are just showing the good parts of the game? Yeah, those are the boring parts in the trailer, actually. There is a visual feast on display that absolutely blows you away when it gets paired with the atmospheric sound design and a fantastic soundtrack that really does a good job pacing the game out and setting the tone as you move through it. \\n\\nIt\\'s hard for a puzzle game to increase in complexity without getting overly complex, but Cocoon managed to not only increase the loose narrative stakes throughout the game, but it also gradually increased the complexity of puzzles in an impressive way that kept surprising me. I love how they used the mechanics like building blocks ending with some genuine brain tickling tests that force you to use all of the tools available to you and show that you were in fact not getting lucky up to that point, but understanding EXACTLY how the puzzle mechanics worked. That being said, it was again, very fair and unfrustrating to work through. \\n\\nFor completionists, there is a function after you beat the game that allows you to go back to any specific point in the game to acquire all of the things you were missing so don\\'t focus too hard on the extra stuff your first playthrough if you wanna get all achievements, just have a good time and enjoy yourself and you can go back later to find what you need. (It also has a statue that shows you where and what you are missing for the extra goodies so no need to guess where stuff is)\\n\\nI wish I had more to say beyond, \"Hey, this kicks ass\", but I don\\'t. This is precisely what is advertised on the outside of the box and does a great job at providing surprises the whole way through that keeps you intrigued and engaged. This is one of those sleeper games that won\\'t get mentioned come GOTY time but absolutely deserves a nod for being fantastic in 2023, a year that is jam PACKED with great games.\\n\\nEasily recommended. \\n\\nFollow my steam curator page for more reviews on indies like this, which helps.\\n\\n[code] https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42143664/ [/code]',\n",

If you have played the latter, you might remember my name from one of the achievements. I even had the honor of meeting Jeppe Carlsen, Jakob Schmid and some other (ex-)Playdead folk and I still cherish the memories of that night.\\n\\nWhen I heard that Carlsen had left Playdead to start his own studio, I was sad on one hand, because I had valued his puzzle design of their games as feeling integral to the world. But on the other hand, I felt excited for what was to come.\\n\\nKnowing Carlsen\\'s work well, I expected this game to put a huge emphasis on game feel and intuitive player guidance with excellent sound design and music integration. And this is pretty much what I got, but I did not, even after watching the trailers, expect this game to look so absolutely gorgeous all of the time on screen.\\n\\nThe game controls nice and fluid, everything can be done with eight directions and a single button. If you play on controller, you have analog movement controls but your character\\'s idle animation can only appear in said eight directions. The music is more calm and atmospheric but there are occasional intense sections in the soundtrack, fitting the action on screen.\\n\\nWhat really boggles my mind is the puzzle design. Knowing Carlsen, I did not expect any less, but the way in which mechanics are introduced to the player, consecutively in didactically designed challenges to the point where it feels completely natural to come up with the solution for the next puzzle made me speechless. There was never a time in the game where I felt lost or stuck, I always had the drive forward but at the same time, the puzzles always provided the right amount of challenge to me and did not seem trivial to solve.\\n\\nThere are very few very, very minor nitpicks that I still feel obliged to state here. The game starts with a \"cold start\" opening which is always cool, but from the player perspective, specifically on PC not always the best, since it prevents players from checking the game’s settings. As a result, the game started, at least for me, in 1080p and 60fps despite my monitor supporting 1440p 144fps and these gorgeous graphics deserve the crispest resolution you can offer them. The other slight issue I found was that some more frequent actions needed a held button press which felt just a tiny tad too long for my taste, to the point where I felt a slight bit of annoyance when I needed to do them often in succession. But as I said, these are absolute minor nitpicks, and the graphics options in the cold start can hopefully be fixed in a future patch.\\n\\nOther than that, I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this game. Its length and dramaturgical development with environmental storytelling combined with gameplay make for definitely the most compelling experience, by far, I\\'ve had with any game I played this year.\\n\\nVery highly recommended.',\n",

At around 3-4 hours to see the credits and $32 Can ($24 USD) price tag this is a premium experience. If you have cash to spare I can't recommend this game enough, but if you are worried about the $ to time spent equation this is a wait for a steep discount game.  \\n\\nI played on the steam deck and while not currently verified this game is a match made in heaven for a handheld console. The game ran flawlessly besides some noticeable fps drops in 2 cut scenes. These performance issues had no impact on game play. The only bugs I encountered are the intended ones such as the main character. \\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The puzzle/level design here is superb, head-scratching but not bruising. There's an almost nonstop variety of ideas; some conventional, many unlike anything else I've seen in a game before. I'd say it falters only the slightest bit when you're doing the sections that require you to activate symbols in the correct order, but even those aren't carbon copies of each other. Immersion has been polished to basically perfection, with zero loading screens after the first boot-up, unintrusive controls, and incredible sounding atmosphere and music. \\n\\nI would've loved a standout challenging final boss after how cool the previous ones were, though I was very satisfied with how the game wrapped up regardless. Any game that has excellent artistic merit while refusing to deprive us of creative and interesting gameplay should be praised.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The start seems a bit too simple for me, but it does pick up in complexity. I had hoped, it would be more like a pure puzzle game (somewhat like Patrick's Parabox maybe), but it's more of an adventure/exploration game with puzzles.\\nWhat bothers me is that the game won't let you experiment much. After solving a puzzle, you can't interact with the elements anymore, because they straight up dissolve or bridges and gates get closed. It feels a bit too guided for me because of this.\\nI'm not sure if it's too short, or if it's just right in length for what it is. [spoiler]The purple sphere wasn't utilized that much, especially in the end part of the game, which is kind of odd. It probably would have been more satisfying if it was used again[/spoiler]\\n[spoiler]There are also boss fights for some reason, lol. Didn't expect that at all, but they're also just puzzles with a fail state.[/spoiler]\\n\\nThe art and sound direction and the whole atmosphere of the game in general are absolutely phenomenal, though. Very very alien, with shapes, nobody could have ever imagined.\\n\\nOverall pretty decent game.\",\n",

It's got all the fun of setting up and operating successful businesses while using the drug theme as a way to keep it different and interesting. If you are looking for a business management/tycoon game that's not too overly complex, but still has a lot of depth to fine tune things, this is the game for you!\\n\\nBeen playing this game since the day it released into early access and I have loved every minute of it. There is just something super satisfying about setting up the factory and businesses and watching it all come together in harmony. It's also incredibly satisfying to start off with just a basic set up and watch it grow into a empire with multiple drug types and tiers.\\n\\nI also personally enjoy the art style of the game. It gives a somewhat simple feel to the game while still including enough details to really see whats happening in the world.\\n\\nTo sum it all up, DNFC is an amazing business management game themed around drug trade. It's incredibly satisfying to play, visually pleasing to look at, and has a banger soundtrack to boot.\\n\\nI seriously cannot recommend this game enough.\",\n",

As it is I wouldn't recommend it. Definitely not good for beginner players of this genre, doesn't really explain much just kinda drops you in, gives you a few directions, and then lets you have at it. Couldn't really figure out what to do, my employees started dying of starvation, my lamps started breaking, and I had no input as to how to fix either. Wouldn't let me hire engineers like I thought you would need to do to fix the lights, and wouldn't let me add snack machines which I thought would be what you need to put down to feed your employees. Overall looks like there's a lot of good, but needs a good bit of work and definitely a better tutorial for people just getting into this genre of game.

       "  'review': \"This game is definitely a good start to a tycoon game. Knowing that it's in early access, I am looking forward to more expansion on narcotics trade as a whole. There are so many challenges that could be added in, from DEA raids, selling to cops and being punished, dealing with customers who are active in addiction then go to rehab so you lose sales, and investigations from the government. \\n\\nAs it stands, [i]Definitely Not Fried Chicken[/i] trends in a way that seems to glamorize the cartel lifestyle, without showing the really heinous parts of drug manufacturing and use. I am not displeased with the weed part of the game, its fun for the most part. Making edibles and prerolls would be a cool addition, as well as a campaign to legalize so you can have a legit store like we do in the better parts of the U.S. \\n\\nWith the meth update, that's where my liking of this game went south. Knowing someone who has recovered from meth abuse, this is [i]insultingly[/i] simplified. Meth is a serious drug that ruins lives and families, its not so easy that people can just buy it once and wait. They should be pounding on the door for it. There should be tweakers busting into cars and robbing stores, I want to see the *real* things that go down with the drug industry, as it stands now, there just isn't enough depth.\\n\\nI hope the devs can learn from people who are either in active addiction or have become sober. There is so much more to this lifestyle that is completely omitted. It seems like a game made by a fan of Breaking Bad, not someone who has [i]any[/i] knowledge of how the illicit drug world works whatsoever.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b]Definitely Not Fried Chicken  was featured on my YouTube channel[/b]\\n\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3017965615\\n\\n\\nand now onto the short review\\n\\n[h1]TL;DR Review[/h1]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n//intro//\\n\\nWelcome back comrades, this is MF Kraven & you are watching less than 10 mins reviews. The Youtube series where I take a look at games i think seem cool & give my thoughts on them in less than 10 mins. I review games in the following format, Buy it Now! Wait for Sale & Do Not Buy!\\n\\nToday I\\'m gonna be taking a look at an EARLY ACCESS version Definitely Not Fried Chicken, a business management sim with a Break Bad twist. Start off as a humble entrepreneur hiring local inner-city farmers & chemists then buy out lots to launder I mean invest in Laundromats, Donut Shops, Fried Chicken & Seafood restaurants. (Night Clubs & Casinos coming at a later date). Have your base of operations distribute your narcotics throughout the city while in competition with a chicken icon in The Major. Could you be this quaint town\\'s new kingpin? Or is DNFC Definitely Not a Good time? Lets find out.\\n\\n\\n\\n//Graphics, Sound & Artstyle//\\n\\nThere\\'s a grimy box pixel art type of aesthetic that perfectly suits this game, the sfx are phenomenal- while a bit repetitive at times, I can clearly hear when my workers are being productive with as much going on. Its welcoming to be able to make it out. The music, just doesn\\'t resonate with me.\\n\\n\\n//Gameplay//\\n\\nIf you like a meticulous micromanagement business sim, this is the one for you. Hire workers for your growhouse from Peons, Engineers, Cleaners and even security. Set their schedules so they dont burn out but also enough to produce product to move. Get a few garages to send your product on mopeds, have them go to specific customers in a map & route them out. Don\\'t like only sending one pound of product? Send some over to the junkyard to unlock cars & trucks to move even more product. Want to grow different strains or even get in the more lucrative field of narcotics? Send some over to the university & they\\'ll start selling you their stuff. But surely with as much money as you will be making, people will notice right? Buy out lots & build business to keep the fuzz off your back- or also distribute directly to customers from your business. Set schedules for your business and make passive income the.. legal way. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n//Price//\\n\\n24.99 USD\\n\\n\\n//How many hours estimated//\\n\\nI\\'m only about 6.5 hours in, and ive only touched the surface I believe. Its a slow grind but very much one of those, let me just get 15 more mins in type of games.\\n\\n\\n//Is it Playable on Steamdeck?//\\n\\nWhile it is playable, I wouldn\\'t recommend it for SteamDeck. You have to be meticulous about your scheduling and going back & forth between lots until you have that perfect schedule set that allows you to bring enough income in to warrant leaving it alone. \\n\\n\\n//Wishlist//\\n\\n*Ability to move rooms, as of now you have to kind of completely renovate everything\\n*Promotions- giving the ability for workers to make other workers take a break or open businesses without you.\\n*More vehicles for transporting product, 2 & 3 package vehicles like smaller car or a bigger moped that can load 2\\n*Options to start selling higher quality narcotics at start, I couldn\\'t open a restaurant because I hadn\\'t unlocked the equipment to make the harder stuff.\\n*the ability to rename workers, & shops\\n*you setting the hours for your businesses, I mean I grew up around shady 24 hr Laundromats & Donut Shops.\\n*setting prices. for the product, for the washing machines, dryers, gumball machines, detergent. setting the prices a bit higher would be nice.\\n*multiple businesses on a single lot. lets say like a strip mall where you can take your dry cleaning to, can grab a donut & maybe even an arcade \\n*more business types! like i mentioned, dry cleaning, arcade, skating rink, mattress stores, just a bunch of business types that everyone questions how they\\'re in business despite never seeing anyone in there.\\n*better UI\\n*finally, more drug types. \\n\\n\\n\\n//Final Thoughts//\\n\\nI absolutely love Definitely Not Fried Chicken. The silly animations, the in depth mechanics, I spent a hell of a lot longer making my laundromat the way I wanted it though, while I allowed the factory or grow-house to just do whatever they wanted (i did have to hire a few workers when I did check back at the grow-house because id work em to death). I\\'m about 7 hours in and I still haven\\'t even made my donut, chicken or seafood restaurant, I love the hard grind but therein lies some problems.\\n\\nWith workers, their needs are always deteriorating. But if you don\\'t have em on a scheduled break they just wont do anything. I\\'ve set a system for my business with Schedule 0,1,2. On 0 they work from 0600 to 1900 but if i see they\\'re unhappy i will switch em over to 1, with is basically break time all day except for 2000 to 23000 when it\\'s time to receive a package from my growhouse, 2 is to send em home. I\\'m still tinkering with scheduling but that seems to be the best for me yet sometimes it\\'s a bit overwhelming. If I go over to improve the growhouse and forget to open the Laundromat then i miss on having passive income that has certainly helped me. Why not leave it open then you ask? Because my machines need maintenance every single day, so I hire an engineer to come and fix em. Cant exactly bring him over when I forget to switch him over to schedule 0. I\\'d love little reminders or even a \"phone call or text\" from my workers to say \"hey boss are we open today or nah\". Any prompt really. I\\'d also love to have a ranking system for workers. Like they can level up and be supervisor, manager etc to give them a bit more responsibility & help your crew in need. Why cant the cleaner who just stands around when she\\'s done also accept product? It\\'s not like they dont clean the warehouse where we keep narcotics?\\n\\nAlso while I\\'m enjoying the long grind, it seems pretty daunting to unlock everything you need to make more money. 90 pts or 45 packages of good weed or 90 packages of bad weed to unlock a car! Now that I\\'ve replaced my mopeds with cars, I don\\'t always have enough product to move. The dispatch system also seems kinda broken. If we get so much hands on work, why not allow our dispatchers to deliver certain kind of product to one customer and while having another one highlighted deliver the rest to that one? Once you get a hotline, customers will light it up to get you to deliver to them, its only until recently however that i realized i could charge more for a promise of better quality product. \\n\\nAnd if I\\'m being completely honest, ive been having a HELL of a good time just running my little laundromat. Getting all the permits to get the absolute best equipment, maximizing my passive income, while also managing the workers there. I almost forget, oh yeah we\\'re running a drug line here \\n\\n\\nAs a shell, this game has the potential to be one of the greatest of all time. So good on the devs for releasing this in EA. While it is almost finished besides adding (ocaine, nightclubs & casinos) the game would be a LOT better with some tweaks (no pun intended) here and there. I have a wishlist since Jan, so for me this is def worth a buy However buyer be warned that this is an extremely niche title.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI guess it\\'s a tricky one but if you were on the fence about getting it, BUY IT NOW! & if you\\'re just shopping around, WAIT FOR SALE! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[h1]Buy it Now![/h1]\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The first being that you cant really have the Moon meth because it needs Vaccum and this vaccum kills everyone that doesnt wear a Astronauts helmet which is very expensive. The second one is the problem with the loading past 75% or not being able to employ new workers for some reason or just the bugs that make the game unplayable.

       "  'review': 'Great game. At its core, it\\'s a resource management and supply lines game. \\n\\nAt this point in development, it is very reminiscent of someone\\'s free-to-play flash-game passion-project. There\\'s a lot there, it\\'s fun, it\\'s creative, but it\\'s jank and very little QOL implemented. But there\\'s a lot of potential, and the devs are active in development. \\n\\nSpeaking to the inevitable early-access jank:\\nAfter running for 2 or 3 hours it gets glitchy and the AI bugs-out and build-mode gets funky. Everything breaks down, but it is still technically playable, just the AI might keep going around in circles or walk around the entire property to use the rear door rather than walk out back. If you enter build-mode and place some rooms, the price will stick on your mouse through gameplay until you go back into build-mode and select then de-select remove room tool. At least, that\\'s the fastest way I\\'ve found to fix that. Also, when placing room tiles, the flooring textures won\\'t change. You\\'ll have a dirty, earthen floor until you restart the game. Then everything fixes itself and the floors appear properly and the AI behaves normally. \\nIf any of these things happen, it\\'s definitely worth a restart as the others are not far behind.\\n\\nThe QOL mechanics are bare-bones. So much is missing from it, as other reviews have pointed-out. Transporting your goods via vehicles seems like an okay system at first, but there is very little customization to it, no custom labeling to easily tell one from another, no customizing their loads numerically (you can flag it open to multiple drugs, but how much is added of each is random and up to the AI, which is also randomly performing whatever tasks you\\'ve flagged for them), etc. They will depart from your \"factory\" only when full, and will attempt to stop at the chosen destination. If it can\\'t, it\\'ll keep circling the block until there\\'s space. Once it reaches its destination it will sit there until others unload it. If you are trying to ship resources to one of your businesses, and the shelf storage for a particular drug is full, the vehicle will sit there indefinitely until space is freed and the last drug is unloaded from the vehicle, or if you manually tell it to return to the factory. That can REALLY fuck with your supply-chain. Also, since flagging a vehicle to multiple drugs just lets the AI randomly load things into it (no numerically customization), it\\'s DEFINITELY worth buying a separate vehicle and using only a single drugs per vehicle. That gets to be an expensive upkeep, but that\\'s the best system I\\'ve found. Also, once you have enough drugs to make that especially expensive, you\\'ve probably making a whole lot of money, anyway. Businesses make a good profit, even without your drugs. The Laundromat, not-so-much (it\\'s a laundromat. No expensive dry-cleaning, just the cheap washers and dryers, and the businesses all have a maximum capacity determined by the star-rating. That is another complain of mine. Bustling businesses are a myth because of this maximum capacity that is enforced, regardless of accomodations).\\nI\\'d LOVE to see a blue-print system implemented into the game. Construction can get tedious, and I find myself constantly looking back to my older businesses to look at the design I thought worked well so I can copy that over to the new business. Cut/copy/paste would also be great. Moving a room as a whole, extending a wall, etc. What they got works, but it\\'s missing some QOL improvements. Looking at this, I\\'ve really taken The Sims building mode for granted.\\n\\nIt\\'s still early-access, and the developers are active. That\\'s promising. This game has a lot of potential, and I\\'d hate to see it abandoned any time soon.',\n",

Once you get more than 5-6 products unlocked the game becomes super stuttery, takes several seconds to load when you snap back to your lab. With that said, my replay-ability was decent as i wanted to do it better the next time. Once they unlock more with Early Access ill revisit for sure. But once you start making enough money, there isn't a lot to do. I have almost abandoned drugs at this point and just opened a bunch of restaurants.

As the saying goes, all that glitters isn\\'t gold; and in DNFC, all that fries certainly isn\\'t chicken.\\n\\nIn DNFC, you\\'re no mere observer. Instead, you\\'re an active participant in the bustling cityscape, donning the dual hat of a respected entrepreneur and a secretive narcotics mogul. DNFC\\'s tutorial offers you a compass to navigate this complex labyrinth. However, like a master painter with a canvas, it provides you the tools but leaves the masterpiece creation to you.\\n\\nThe game\\'s charm is skillfully baked into its attention to detail. Each decision, from buying plots for your drug compound, mapping production lines, to orchestrating distribution routes, impacts your empire. Couple this with the task of safeguarding your operations from prying eyes, and you have an intricate, immersive world that rewards both strategy and creativity.\\n\\nYet, the game’s essence doesn\\'t lie solely in the clandestine operations. The vibrant townsfolk, with their outrageous demands, add a splash of color to your journey. Fulfilling their eccentric requests not only unlocks secret costumes but also provides an enjoyable respite from your core operations, amplifying DNFC’s appeal.\\n\\nMaintaining your cover through proper management of your \\'legal\\' businesses is just as crucial. Whether it\\'s streamlining your kitchen staff\\'s efficiency, scheduling the unloading of trucks, or ensuring customer satisfaction, every detail pulls you deeper into DNFC\\'s meticulously crafted narrative.\\n\\nGranted, DNFC is in early access, and there are still pieces of this intriguing puzzle to be unveiled. However, this doesn\\'t detract from the game\\'s current allure. Instead, it whets your appetite for what\\'s yet to come.\\n\\nHaving clocked a whopping 56.9 hours, it\\'s clear that DNFC is more than a mere tycoon/management sim. It\\'s a game that stirs your entrepreneurial instincts, challenges your strategic skills, and rewards you with a rich, immersive experience that is equal parts exciting and rewarding.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you\\'re hunting for a management sim that offers an audacious twist on the genre, Definitely Not Fried Chicken is your answer. With its rich narrative, engaging gameplay, and beautifully crafted world, it\\'s a digital playground you won\\'t want to leave!\\n\\nScore: 9.5/10 - [i]\"A sublime journey into the glitz and glamour of the 80s, where running a business is as thrilling as it is rewarding. Don\\'t miss out on this rollercoaster of a game!\"[/i]',\n",

The concept is fantastic, reminiscent of managing a storefront for a underground business, and it instantly struck a chord with me.\\n\\nEven though it is still in Early Access, the game shows great promise and is already worth every penny. The developers have managed to capture the essence of fun and deliver an engaging experience. From the moment I started playing, I found myself immersed in the world of running a quirky, yet captivating, establishment while building my underground empire.\\n\\nThe gameplay is a load of fun, and I have thoroughly enjoyed exploring the various challenges and intricacies of managing a chicken-themed business. The attention to detail and the humor infused throughout the game truly enhance the overall experience.\\n\\nI am genuinely excited to see how Definitely not Chicken Fried evolves throughout its Early Access journey. With such a strong start, I have high hopes for its future updates and refinements. If you're a fan of management games whit a shady twist, this game is an absolute must-try.\\n\\nOverall, Definitely not Chicken Fried is a gem in Early Access, offering a delightful blend of nostalgia, promising gameplay, and loads of fun. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an enjoyable and engaging gaming experience.\\n\\n[b]Score: 9/10[/b]\",\n",

Then cram as many scooter drives as you possibly can until you unlock cars by delivering to the scrap yard. \\n\\nThere is plenty to keep you occupied for now, but I'm excited for the additional content to be added during early access. So far there seems to be 3 weed variants and meth (so you can go full Breaking Bad). Coca is shown as coming during EA, but I sure hope they go way further with the production lines available to you. All of that being said, there is much more variety in front businesses you are able to run than production lines at the moment. I'll be revisiting this game regularly.\",\n",

I even waited for an update before leaving a review in hope it was coming. \\nThis is a HUGE issue and its been an issue since release. There's even another review that the developers responded to saying they were looking into it. That was nearly 7 months ago and its still not fixed. Until it is. I don't recommend it. Early access games are bound to have issues but not being able to access the game should be the number one concern. Just wait for the full release and hopefully it will be fixed at that point.\\n\\nUpdate: Game full released today and I tested all the saves. Still not loading past 75%\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Its a good game. I feel it does need some major adjustments before it becomes playable though. I feel like doors should only take up the square they swing out to. I think you don't earn enough money from the game, I think the values need to be increased slightly by around 1-5$ per transaction. I think that one major issue is that people don't show up to work on time, If I send people home and their work starts at 8 they shouldn't be rolling in at 9:37 and me still be paying them for an hour of work that didn't happen. I feel like there needs to be more than 6 schedules, maybe 6 schedules for each type of worker. I think that you should also be able to prioritize tasks. Ex. This employee will run the register, if no customer's are around he will prep chicken and fries. My biggest pet peeve is that I feel I cannot make a profit unless I am constantly adjusting everything my employees are doing. I feel once I set up my entire shop and get things running it should stay running unless a disaster strikes or I over value something like no time for food. Finally, if an employee has nothing to do they should use that time to use the break room and fix their stats. Its a really fun and creative game, with extreme potential. Disregard this comment if the updates patch these things out.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Fun game. Love sim games that let you build your own custom workshops and have workers assigned to jobs.\\n\\nUnderstand this is an early access review as of 6/24/23 \\nSeems like there is going to be a lot more added in the future that will make even better automation possible and better production as well. \\n\\nMy current gripes about the game are relatively small but here are some I wish would be implemented\\n1. Exit to Main Menu Button. Not just an exit game button.\\n2. Dispatch groups and auto dispatching so I don't have to open the dispatch menu every 10 seconds to assign separate vehicles to make deliveries. I would like them to complete and assign them on their own but also have a separate grouping for delivering to businesses only or time limited deliveries.\\n3. Time speed at max speed still feels too slow. Especially early game this can lead to a lot of just sitting on the phone and waiting for income to be able to do anything at all which is not fun.\\n4. As of right now there is no event I have come across besides the opening one getting attacked by a rival business/former employer and the annoying rocket ship guys who will ask for a delivery and if you say no they will pester you every 3 minutes. Please add more asap even just defending the drug warehouse from a couple guys with bats or something.\\n5. Maybe a send employees home button for when there are fires as closing the shop only keeps customers out and the employees will mindlessly walk into the flame so either I fire them to send them home, waste a limited schedule space to send them home, or let them burn. Please add maybe a fire extinguisher, sprinklers, or a call fire department button maybe? Also adding a send home button would be nice if you need to save some income early on rough days or when accidentally overspending. \\n6. Maybe a story about overthrowing other rival businesses that pop up in the neighborhood as you progress by opening your own outlets.\\n\\nSo far the game has been fun but short as of right now but looking forward to the full release. :)\",\n",

I know you get a little bit more for timed orders(which should be double or triple since its such a short amount of time) but this needs to change.\\n-Lower the cost of appliances. It shouldn\\'t cost $50 per appliance a day to run some heaters/lights/etc. Not so much a problem later in the game but those costs add up when you\\'re riding the struggle bus early game.\\n-Tweaks to the monuments. The building that gives you longer work hours could be changed so there is an unlock for 24/7 business operation.\\n-Timed missions and phone orders need to be worked out better. Why timed side missions for special customers? They keep asking you to complete the orders anyways after rejecting them so why not just take the timer away.\\n-When you buy a piece of land for the factory the price of the next land purchase increases. Could just have every piece of land for the factory be $10,000 a piece. The entire main square would still cost almost $500,000 with that price point.\\n-AOE needs to be better for everything. I don\\'t want to put 3+ large heaters/ac units/humidifiers/etc into a small room for the 3 star rating when it should only take 1 or 2 of them.\\n-AC/Heater/Lights/Etc should all cap at 100 instead of the different numbers they are currently capped at. This could tie into the AOE mentioned above for better coverage.\\n\\nBreaking Bad/10\\n\\n*edit: added bug*',\n",

       "  'review': \"I picked up this game last week and have been really enjoying it! \\n\\nIt's still in early access but there is a lot that you can do to have fun in the game. I strongly enjoy this game but do have some ideas for the developers after playing for a bit.\\n\\nRe-playability: I would really really really enjoy seeing this concept fleshed out a bit more in depth. I feel like the game progression in your vision is to Grow Weed -> Cook Meth -> Produce Coke. I propose a concept of choose your end-game where you can flesh out each drug empire as their own path. IF a player wishes, they can dabble in multiple drug trades. However I would find it very interesting if you could get to End-Game while fine-tuning one of the drug trades. \\n\\nExample: The Cannabis production -  Stretch it out \\n\\nThe player is able to go from Cannabis to Toasted and Amazonian very quickly and it doesn't take much to get the balance of heat/humidity for 3 Star Product lines. Leaving the next logical path to delve into the Meth trade, but what If it was an option to continue evolving your Cannabis instead of migrating to meth. \\n\\n4 Progression Trees - \\n\\n1st Tree is Empire - Works as currently set up where you can progress to each trade and get 3 Instances of Each Product line for 9 options. \\n2nd Tree is Grower - Unlocks a 4th and 5th Cannabis types but blocks off the 3rd Instance of Meth/Coke. 9 options\\n3rd Tree is Chemist - Unlock a 4th and 5th Meth type but blocks off 3rd Instances of Cannabis/Coke   9 options\\n4th Tree is Socialite - Unlocks a 4th and 5th Coke type but blocks off 3rd Instance of Cannabis/Meth   9 options\\n\\nProgression can work similarly to Junk Yard/Uni/Guns where you send delivery out for skill points but you must purchase upgrades in order. First x amount of points unlocks the choice of a progression tree. The 4th and 5th products of each trade can be more complicated to get the right balance of temperatures/humidity/light (smaller thresholds) \\n\\nStaff - \\n\\nI enjoy managing the staff for each establishment but having to adjust the schedule can be tedious, Would love some options to click/drag to change states so we can make a full schedule easier without so much clicking. \\n\\n\\n\\n5/5 - This game is awesome for a Early Access game and I very much look forward to more like this!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"A interesting concept for a game but it feels like a alpha at best. \\n\\n1st the game is absurdly slow with progression you will spend entire days with the game just running at max speed to make enough money to do anything, because employee limits are tied to land which is expensive to start you'll grow your operation so slowly that you wish something, anything would happen but this leads to the next problem. Combind with how worthless your vehicles are til upgraded you've got alot of running the game in the background.\\n\\n2, Nothing ever happens; There's only 2 scripted events in the game where you can even be attacked from what I can tell, both times tied to progress. Both of these attacks are not only completely unwinnable even if every single employee is a guard but there's a entire gameplay mechanic around hiring these guards and outfitting them, which you will never do since even if you could get attacked you don't have the employee limits to maintain any kind of force unless your leaving the game on overnight to afford half a coffee shop.\\n\\n3, Logistic wise its nonexistant. You can't name routes, or vehicles, or set even the most basic of import limits for them to follow. So lets say you have a donut shop which is selling all 3 kinds of weed, you have space to store 12 of each. If you have 12 of #1, 10#2 and 0 of #3 and the vehicle pulls up with 1 of #1 and you got nowhere to put it, it will sit there forever til space is availible. This creates huge bottlenecks, which lead to workers sitting idle, customers complaining you don't have the right things availible for purchase, ect. \\n\\n4, AI workers work about 90% of 50% of the time. Your only control over workers is what hours they work, and what tasks and rooms they can be in. You can't prioritize any task over another e.g. Only haul to drivers if you have no Weed #2 related jobs availible, ect you can only say do both and it's random what they'll do. \\n\\nA good example of this is mechanics who will ignore broken machines (which the game won't tell you why, supposedly theres a 20 tile radius they work in and what that means exactly is never explained) as they wander around randomly even directly past broken equiptment and you can only set room groups for them to work in, so you'd think it would be all the devices in those rooms right? Wrong. \\n\\n5 Lastly, setting up your actual base is also a pita. There's no options to manually make walls dividing rooms or the like. So in the case of say Weed #2 and Weed #3 having conflicting requirements you'll need to seperate them by building completely superflous rooms with empty land inbetween instead of using a simple divider. Doing this spreads the base out further, which breaks the AI further. Most objects need the area infront of them completely unobstructed and can't share this space, which results in needing huge rooms to tetris objects in despite there being no reason why you can't make a trash can and soda machine can both face the same empty tile.\\n\\nI could go on about a laundry list of other issues, customer complaints that you can't do anything about decoration (cuz it doesn't exist) or tempature (doesn't affect people), quest's that have absurdly short deadlines that are near impossible to do without express knowledge their about to happen like npc Jack asking for 20 of something in 10 in game minutes (hope you got 3 unused trucks and 4 pallets worth of it ready it's failed with a complete loss of all your stuff), ect ect. \\n\\nMaybe in couple years of dev this might be worth playing if they completely redo about 2/3 of the systems, but that's gonna be alot of work.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Not going to lie watching and playing are 2 very different experiences. \\n\\nThe game UI is REALLY BAD. Honestly watch someone play and just look at the U.I. and imagine yourself fumbling through it to get anything done. It's unbearably forgettable and unclear. I had to do the tutorial 2 times just to remember how to put up walls. Then the remove walls and put up walls buttons both highlight for put up walls making it even more confusing, and then sometimes instead of making a room it will delete a room haha. Honestly whats wrong with the brain of whoever designed this!\\n\\nSo outside of the U.I. being super unfun to navigate, the game isn't even all that fun. Navigating from the map, to making your stores, to managing deliveries and scheduling routes/employee hours/open close is really not satisfying. The only time i felt even a little bit of that business owner enjoyment was getting a laundry mat to tier 3 and watching the happiness go up a bit along with going to 4 stars. It was only temporary though as there doesn't really feel like a goal. \\n\\nHonestly my final thoughts are that they couldn't seem to capture what makes a simulator game fun. This one is a bit too tedious, doesn't look great, doesn't give any feeling of reward honestly, and everything feels super arbitrary. There are way way better simulation games out there, hell i've played better ones on my phone. this just isn't it.\",\n",

Put it all together, it instantly set alight, killing ALL of my employees. So that's fine, my error, I didn't realise the kitchen needs to be minimum -30 degrees (which is silly in the first place). So built it all again, put the fryers down that I'd bought, that were low health, and it instantly caught fire AGAIN. Unless I sell them and buy NEW fryers there's no way to deal with this. It seems like an awkward work around and honestly I really can't be bothered now. I stomache'd through a lot of issues, the clunky UI because I enjoyed the gameplay loop but that's really taken me out of it and genuinely made me angry.\\n\\nAs above, I'll reconsider this review upon release.\",\n",

I would love more options with decorations including walls, floors, indoor dec. One thing that annoyed me the most is that whenever I move a plant or a shelf I lost everything in it. Staff limit is pointless, nobody tells me in a real business how many people I can employ. \\nI played with many EA games but this one shouldn`t even be out yet.

Yes.

Engineers will pace back a forth trying to get to a couple of things to repair but will never make it to any of them while the rest of you factory disintegrates because the engineer is stuck. I\\'ve had workers randomly start working jobs they aren\\'t assigned to. The order of your employees and drivers in the UI will change after you save & exit the game then come back later. Managing deliveries becomes very tedious once you have a bunch of drivers and there is no automation to deliveries. If one of your business\\' stock room fills up while you aren\\'t watching? Well that driver will sit in front of the business forever waiting to be unloaded. The UI is clunky and missing some basic features like \"exit to menu\". You have to exit to windows then relaunch if you want to get to the main menu. Again, there is a lot of potential and I wish I could keep playing it, but I hope the developer focuses on getting the core of the game working well before adding more content because the content isn\\'t going to matter when basic things don\\'t work.',\n",

Its a fun management game with enough aspects to it to keep me occupied with a youtube video. Wish there was a faster time skip as it is not suuper fast, especially during night. Don't AFK the game once you get a consistent positive income stream till you get max SP and money, it will take away from the game. I say, make more legal buisnesses, make more illegal buisnesses. Maybe add some competition making you lower your price to compete or fight the competition, possibly killing your guards. What im seeing negatively is just a lack of factors. The stuff added is fun and functional, just make it a full game and the small amount of content addition that I see isnt going to do that.

Its an extremely easy game to beat and i really dont see how bringing in cocaine will change this. \\n\\nThere are almost zero \"events\" and the \"story\" outside the tutorial is basically nonexistent. There is nothing to overcome, no goals, no challenges. Further i have a massive operation, i have 54 factory workers and i produce more drugs than my 10 shops can sell. Even with a massive operation im only using 1/3 of the allowed build space for my factory. There is no need for the rest. When coke comes in i will need to buy 1 plot that is it. \\n\\nI almost feel like i was ripped off. This could port to mobile and fit right in. Its right on the boarder of being an idle clicker game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This game hits so many right buttons for me that I have to recommend it. While there are plenty of problems and updates don't come out at a regular pace, I still believe this is worth a buy even at its current state. \\n\\nWhere this game does right is the idea of building and maintaining both a lab and a front or fronts for your business of NOT selling chicken. Usually you'd only be in charge of procuring and then distributing product, well now you also get to make a KFC to sell less than legitimate products alongside some tasty chicken. This is great and it pleases my simple brain when I do, finally, manage to create a positive cash flow.\\n\\nWhere this game doesn't quite hit the mark is from a number of ongoing issues. There are a number of bugs that can effectively keep you from playing. Usually these are resolved by relauching the game, but having to do so multiple times per hour can become a real chore. This only becomes more tedious when loading times can be seen as on the long side(I currently have it on an SSD and it still takes a minute or two to get the game launched and back into my current save file.) \\n\\nLastly, is a certain amount of imbalances in the game itself. At the start the tutorial gives you a rundown of how to start and maintain a business/front. These are relatively charming and simple to understand as you go. However, it has a way of kicking you into the lions den the moment it's over. You help repair and restart a business for another company and the moment you finish the business portion of the tutorial you get fired on the spot. The tutorial takes this chance to introduce you to your very own Sal lawyer guy as the explanation of the Not chicken side of things. The problem with this is the fact that it doesn't set you up for success as soon as they are done feeding you this side of things. You have a barely functioning 'Not chicken' lettuce supply and nothing else, it doesn't urge you to build a business outside of vaguely mentioning the teaching guides on the top before leaving you on your own. \\n\\nTutorial aside this is the least of your worries at the start. You have only a production of 'lettuce' and no fronts, so now what? Well it gives you access to a group of bikes to deliver product, so that should be enough right? Sadly this is another point for imbalance. Your first orders over the request system is for eight pieces of 'Definitely Not Fried Chicken' each and each job has an output of somewhere between eight and nine hundred dollars. Great! However your starting bikes can only hold one piece of lettuce and makes for horribly slow progress. This becomes only worse when you sell your first piece of lettuce from a front(if you manage to get so far as to start the first of the 'optional' side tutorials) and find that each piece of lettuce sold is worth almost four hundred dollars! So this basically makes any deliveries to these requests completely unprofitable. \\n\\nTL;DR \\n\\nWhere this game may have issues and I have a better ability to describe faults than praises due to my own inexperience with other management games like this to compare it to, it still manages to draw me in and peak my interest. I recommend it because it has so much potential and I want nothing more than to see where it goes as the developers put more love and care into it. \\n\\nAfter thought:\\n\\nI was made to write this after discovering the strange disconnect between front lettuce money gain and the requests. This was such a huge problem that I had to put it somewhere! Please, developers, this is among your biggest issues that isn't the usual complaint about locked content. The balance between requests and fronts is astronomical and at the beginning the ability to actually survive as nothing but a dealer of 'not fried chicken' without a front is completely impossible without the access to trucks.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This one of those games that has potential, it's just not quite there yet. I'll explain.\\n\\nRight now it's two main issues are, lack of content (but there is plenty planned.) and issues with general game logic.\\nThe lack of content is pretty much a guaranteed when considering Early Access titles, so I'll give this issue a free pass. However, there needs to be some major changes logic-wise in order for me to turn this frown upside down.\\n\\nThe building system is, how should I put it, rudimentary at best. There are certain exclusion zones around items that do not need to exist. For example, each tile can only hold one object, the tile adjacent to the object is it's 'interaction zone', you cannot place objects within an interaction zone, or overlap interaction zones. This is a big issue as, for example, doors have an interaction zone on either side. Thus making the building of rooms clunky. You can't, for example, put a door next to a microwave, a UV light (which hangs from the ceiling) over a planter and plenty more other small, yet highly frustrating issues.\\n\\nThe logistics system is similarly frustrating. If your business fills up on a particular stock, lets say regular cannabis, the car delivering 2 units of Cannabis, 1 unit of Toasted and 1 unit of Amazonian will sit there forever until you eventually sell 2 units of regular Cannabis and the vehicle is now empty. This clogs up the system and is highly inefficient, with larger logistics vehicles planned this will only get worse. \\nWhat it should do is make a check to see if the assigned stores are full and if so, return to the depot or go to the next delivery assignment. Better yet, have the store check for what it needs and make the request from the factory to begin with.\\n\\nWorkers need a priority list of assignments. If there are customers waiting to be served and a logistics vehicle waiting to be emptied and you only have limited employees, the player should be able to decide which they want to tackle first. Rather than have to employ far more employees than necessary to cover all bases at all times. Just as with the logistics, this is highly inefficient.\\n\\nRight now, I cannot recommend this game. Within a few hours I've pretty much seen all there is to see and spotted a few major issues that will grind the game down as more content is added. As far as the gameplay loop is concerned, it's great. It just needs a lot more mechanical refinement and about another year or two in the oven before it's ready. I don't regret spending the money as I see good potential in the future.\",\n",

I wouldn't recommend to get the game at its current state as it has a long way to go because apparently its an early access launch within an early access.\\n\\nYou get 3 front businesses to setup and run, 3 types of weed production and 1 type of meth production and that's it. The rest is locked away in early access hahaha! The game at its core is pretty fun. By setting up the fried chicken business you get to feel like you're the boss of Los Pollos Hermanos. Other than that, the delivery of product needs a lot of work. If not micromanaged, the products will get delivered to the wrong store. There is a garage indicator on the map but it doesn't show which is a car or a moped right until it leaves out for delivery. Workers may stop working, the UI is basic and pretty straight forward. Doesn't take too long getting used to it. Graphics are okay as the main focus is production and delivery of products to your customers and how you can improvise and create a better and faster production line. I feel it should be more that just 4 worker slot for each plot purchased to produce your products. \\n\\nThere are a lot of improvements to be made to this game and I hope the devs will deliver the rest of the early access content soon and make more interesting content for the game. I will give this a thumbs up but I wouldn't want you to spend your money on something that is still baking.

The graphics are finger-lickin\\' good and the controls are crispy and responsive. The storyline is so juicy, I can\\'t wait to see how it will all pan out in the full release.\\n\\nBut, there are a few cons to this early access version. The menu options are a bit limited, making it hard to navigate and find what you\\'re looking for. And sometimes, the character\\'s dialogue feels a little dry and under-seasoned. But these minor issues aside, I\\'m definitely looking forward to getting my beak into the full release of this game.\\n\\nIn conclusion, \"Definitely Not Fried Chicken\" is shaping up to be a tasty and enjoyable game that\\'s worth a try.

First allow products in vehicles be taken out or don't let that product be dropped off at hotlines if it's the wrong item. Second, have a queue waiting times for hotlines instead of the drivers taken ridiculous routes to get back to the destination. Third, allow us to move product off of storage shelves without having to loose all the product by picking up the shelf. I have encountered some bugs nothing really game breaking yet, Mainly menu items not going away and staying with the cursor, Also pro tip, specially with cooking food, just because you have an outfit to cook faster at least for now, I wouldn't recommend using them because the workers constantly drop items making them contaminated.\",\n",

That means that the total number of workers will not decrease, leaving the player with an even smaller availability of workers.\\n- deleting a shift schedule results sometimes in not being able to reassign workers at a different one or fire them. the game will automatically set them with a $700 a day salary and they will not do any task\\n- workers of the drug factory will not work after you reassign them to another task\\n\\nalso please add the possibility for workers of the drug factory to sleep. They are always tired and drop the products on the floor to go to sleep.\\nAlso the feature to name and reorder the list of employees will be a nice feature, maybe adding a small preview of how they look and what clothes they are wearing could be a nice idea to make the game more intuitive.\\nadd the possibility for the cars to automatically collect the product required for deliveries and stop giving away what for free what the deliver doesn’t ask for or what has already been satisfied\\n\\nI’m sorry for my bad english, I know the developers will do wonders with this game!\\n',\n",

So don't expect shootouts and gang warfare fighting over turf. A very high percentage of the game is locked(check the road map). With 2 million dollars and the game just making endless money i've now lost interest. you have nothing to spend your money on so even with the unlocks of bigger business later on, i see no point. Give us mansions an avatar to customize and an entourage or something(think Scarface the ps2 game). i just feel like a tycoon not a drug lord.

Not worth the price AT THE MOMENT.\\n\\nReview: After spending a decent amount of time in this game, in it\\'s current state I can\\'t recommend buying it. Too much needs to be done.\\nIssues: \\n* Character AI is terrible. Nothing worse than people you are paying to do a job standing around. (They are fixing this as a priority)\\n* Monuments do not work (known issue, added to the list)\\n* \"upgraded\" equipment does not offer any additional benefit (known issue)\\n* Delivery path finding needs work. Time sensitive deliveries and my drivers are doing circles around the block.\\n* two \"employees\" per purchase of production land is just not enough, needs re-balancing / increasing or have security personnel as it\\'s own capacity and separated from workers.\\n\\nTechnical issues:\\n* Poorly optimised. Once your empire is \"big\" then game performance just tanks.\\n* After a relatively decent amount of playtime it chews through my RAM, using in excess of 10GB\\n* Random crashes, usually jumping from owned properties/fronts via the menu icon. (Save often)\\n* UI elements just stop working and are unresponsive randomly. Character equipment sheet and interacting with placeable objects mainly.\\n\\nAll this is known to the devs and I\\'m sure there are other issues I just have not raised.\\n\\nNote to devs: Please change the default settings for any object that can be \"filtered\" for accepted items to nothing (default is set to accept EVERYTHING) upon placement rather it would be better to let me filter manually after placement. examples include: Storage shelves, delivery vehicles, processing equipment.  There is nothing more annoying than trying to add storage/delivery route for meth (or other products) and your workers charge in with hands full of everything else and start throwing it on a shelf. This is a QoL improvement that in my opinion is just needed.\\n\\nOverall, when this game has had some more work and optimisation done to it, it will be a very chill, fun game. I will revisit this in the future and if they fix the issues I will change my recommendation but for now I cannot recommend it. Give it time.\\n\\nEdit: grammatical and conciseness changes.',\n",

Inside, you can be thinking about your homework, or friends, or your side business, but no one should ever know it. Because at Los Pollos Hermanos, someone... Is always watching.

       "  'review': 'For me this is a definite reccomend!\\n\\n“you know that watermelon in Japan they grow by putting them in a box? Well, they did that but with people” - Dev\\n\\nAll my game time so far has been on the steam deck, so first of all, the games aesthetic is fitting and well done, it has that 80’s vibe as advertised. I’m not sure where the dev is from, but back in the 80’s we used to have these coffee/hot chocolate machines that look exactly like one of the drink machines in DNFC. I keep one in my drug factory kitchen, makes me smile every time I see it, reminds me of those sweet molten hot-hot chocolates at a hockey game/practice.\\n\\nAnother thing I really enjoy is the almost perfect balance of micromanagement and idler type of gameplay, there is just the right amount of mix, the drug making randos  require little input in to what they do, and more emphasis is placed on fine tuning your operations to find the right schedules, planning workflow, etc to get the most efficient operation as possible.\\n\\nHowever one thing I find the game lacks, for me anyway, would be an optional “refinement method”. For instance with weed, I think something like adding curing as an optional process, having a curing station which would take additional time at a slower progress rate. Jar up the weed, let it sit for some time and add a “Top Shelf” quality level, or even a nutrient mix station which depending on your nutrient mix could make the plant grow mutant huge, crazy fast, double harvest amount. \\n\\nOne major flaw I find at this point in the game would be I find the UI a tad clunky and unintuitive, but this is EA and I’m sure there are QOL and UI refinements in the future so this really isn’t a dealbreaker in my books. My other gripes are largely related to a few bugs, but again, not a dealbreaker for me.\\n\\nOne bug I found that made me giggle for hours was when one of my gardeners glitched up and he had a watering can stuck in his hand constantly spraying water, spraying water in bed, spraying water as he was being sprayed by water in the shower, eating meals, it was hilarious, everywhere this man went, he was spraying water, some say he still sprays water constantly to this day!\\n\\nThe game has only crashed on me once so far, and it was a really hard crash, frame rate plummeted and locked up my steam deck, so I had to get out of my lazy-boy to reset my Gaben deck, and this made me angry, until it didn’t.\\n\\nI’m really hoping there will be more music added, while I like the music, I need a bit more variety.\\n\\nOverall I really enjoy the game, yea the asking price as the game sits is a bit steep, but as a fan of tycoon games, I’ve spent more for less for sure. I like the fact the people in the game are grown in boxes on the ground in Japan like the watermelons, the game has some deep lore.\\n\\nSo easy buy for me, I hope the dev keeps going strong, as I’m excited to watch this game grow!',\n",

       "  'review': 'Good game now with a big potential and lots of rough edges in it\\'s current state. Now I have only played 2 hours so far but I can get an idea about a game from that. It\\'s more indepth and engaging than I thought it would be. The \"clucky\" graphics you barely even notice after 15 minutes.  Some things that need work. It would be fun if you could name your toons. Maybe you can but I didn\\'t notice if you could. The toons don\\'t seem to upgrade their skills. Which seems an obvious thing to do but maybe I didn\\'t get far enough into the game yet? The tutorial is crap. To be honest, the things it explained well I could either figure out for myself or knew from other games. Or the things I didn\\'t, often the tutorial more confused me than helped me.  It can be confusing to figure out what the hell they are saying to do. Several times I did what I thought was right but the tutorial wouldn\\'t forward until I \"randomly\" tried other things. If you do something in the tutorial before it asks you to do it, you have to undo that thing and redo it for the tutorial to register that you did it. Several times when it did forward, I got a black screen with a movable cursor that made me have to start over again. And one time the tutorial just would not forward to the next part no matter what I did. And I clicked on every possible thing I could have. I just got a arrow point to something to click on and when I clicked on that button a new screen came up with another arrow. I click on that button and it takes me back to the first screen. Rinse and repeat. But none of these things seem to happen in the actual game. And I just skipped by the tutorial after awhile and was pretty much fine.\\n\\nSome BIG annoying things in game is 1. you build these rooms with nice thick walls. But the toons don\\'t respect the walls at all. They more often than not walk right through them. And when they don\\'t walk through them they don\\'t always take the quickest way to where they need to go. 2. If you build a room and decide to expand it later, the ground dosn\\'t seem to expand with the room. In other words, what passes as dirt in the game stays as dirt for the floor and one room seems to have kept the original walls from the first build of the room but they don\\'t affect the toon going to the new area. 3. When you first start the game, the main bad guy just sends a few of his overpowered troops to your place and wipes out everybody and everything. Now you have to rehire and get an engineer to fix everything. Why? It looks cute but more annoying than cute. 4. I really don\\'t like having to hold the scroll wheel as you move the mouse to move around the screen and the right button to turn. It seems to me that should be reversed if anything. Having basically skipped most of the tutorial, or maybe I really didn\\'t because there is no hint at all that there was much more to it than I saw, I found myself unable to figure out how to upgrade the quality of my products. I.E. make better pot. It clearly says you can and I know putting lights in helps do this but they don\\'t seem to be doing it so far. The first crop or two is high quality but after that it\\'s all trash. Even with the lights. It says certain things affect the quality but it really dosn\\'t say what things you need to use to affect what or what the crop needs to be better quality. How does buying a \"front\" business help me? I know why in real life but not in game. And a few other things. Also, there seems to be some sort of point system that when you get enough points it unlocks more items to use. I have no idea how that works but I seem to be getting points some how. Hey, it\\'s a pre release, these things are to be expected.\\n\\nHaving said all that, the game is a lot of fun and most of the things I complained about are minor easily fixable things you expect in a pre release. Would I buy it again now knowing this? Sure. It\\'s playable and fun and it seems addictive. Given more time I can find the answers I need or figure them out myself.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Edit Post Major Patch 1: Still rough, but getting better. Fewer bugs overall, but it felt like I needed to restart the game more to get rid of some little issue than I remember. New content, but I didn't have the time to put in to get through the early game to try it. The time speed in this game seems a bit slow, and doing most things takes significant time and investment with often small margins for error. I would like to see some sort of a planning mode that works with the overlays, or at least the ability to sell purchased equipment within a short timeframe for the same price it's bough for, because figuring out ideal layouts can be tricky and take some trial and error. It sucks to have to eat the cost because the game doesn't give you a way to work it out without spending money.\\n\\nOverall, still the same sentiment: I currently would only recommend this to people who really enjoy management style games who are willing to support an unfinished game that shows potential.\\n\\nOriginal Review\\n\\nVery Early Access, but a very good concept and it could be a great end product. I plan to update this review as the game develops. For now it is a recommend with caveats.\\n\\nIt's buggy right now and a large chunk of planned content isn't implemented yet, so don't buy if you're looking for a polished experience. That said, the bones of a good game are here, and I'm excited to see how this game evolves. I was excited to restart as I learned ways to make my operation more profitable or efficient, and the systems are engaging and complex enough that every run felt (and ended) different. \\n\\nLogistics plays a large role in everything on both a micro and macro scale. The distance between your workstations, the lengths of your hallways, and even the path your trucks must take to reach other destinations is something you'll want to keep in mind. I find that challenge stimulating, though I would like to see some further development. The ability to set task priorities for workers, box and ship intermediate production items (like uncooked donuts, for example), and the ability to set custom routes for transports would be great. To go from great to incredible would be implementing rotating availability of a larger number of purchasable properties and logistic hubs like warehouses or garages to allow for more complex supply chains.\\n\\nThis game has plenty of positives, but I currently would only recommend this to people who really enjoy management style games who are willing to support an unfinished game that shows potential. Some of the bugs currently being worked on should have been found with just regular play testing before release, there were some choices that felt like they were the result of a rushed release, and this game is too new to know for sure how the devs will progress, but I'm rooting for this game and I think it could be great.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]EDIT: Updated Review at the Bottom[/h1]\\n\\nSo far, this game is a pretty good example of \"EA\" that people complain about the most.  I\\'ve been following this game for a year or 2 and was excited to see it finally out.  I normally don\\'t have a problem with EA games and still can find some fun in them, but this game makes it hard to.\\n\\nFirst off, it\\'s the same ol\\' tale that you are seeing on reviews for this game: Tutorial sucks.  It really sucks.  It has you do the bare minimum and then just...stops.  I can\\'t really say it just \"stops.\"  More like that common movie trope where the dying old man is about you tell you the biggest secret in the whole universe but just gasps and dies.  Like Yoda, about to tell Luke about Vader, but just disappears into thin air.  Yeah, that\\'s how this tutorial works out. \\n\\n\\nLike others have said, Time is slow and I wish they fully explained it so I will.  Unlike games like the Sims, Two Point series, Planet Coaster/Zoo, when you hit the fast forward buttons, time moves very fast.  This game\\'s option is normal, normalish, normallishish. See, you need to make deliveries to get paid, but the city is rather large and it takes quite a while to make a delivery.  Not to mention, each delivery requires 7 drop offs to get paid (which, btw, the tutorial never talks about). Clicking on the fastest option doesn\\'t really help a thing.  I\\'m not asking to skip an entire day but can we have a sense of urgency?\\n\\nThen there are several upgrades and items that have literal \"EA\" on them. I mean, that is expected in an Early Access title.\\n\\n\\nIf for some reason you still want to get this game I have to tell you, be prepared to start a new game a few times until you can figure this mess out.  However, and this drives me crazy, if you need to start a new game, the only option you have is to exit out of the whole game, open the game up again in Steam and then choose a new game. There is no way to \"Exit to Main Menu.\"  I don\\'t understand how basic menu features are none existent in this game that allows you to have multiple saves.  \\n\\nI love management games and this one is unique and right up my alley.  However, they decided to be a little too unique with their strange design choices, that I can\\'t recommend this game AS IS.  I can see this game being better in 6 months and even \"Great\" by the time it leaves Early Access.  Devs have already been acknowledging a lot of the bugs and hopefully some QOL.  As for now, wait a bit.\\n\\n[h1]UPDATED REVIEW:[/h1] \\n\\nSo, I\\'ve added several hours to this game but don\\'t let that you fool you.  In order to get a good chunk of money going, I highly recommend letting the game run as you go do chores/work/errands and etc.  With more money in the bank you\\'ll be able to explore more about the game.  In doing so, I have found out more things I dislike about this game:\\n\\nThings that have AOE (Area of Effect) are pretty trash in this game right now.  There are certain conditions that need to be met in order to grow a high quality drug such as temperature and light.  You have basic UV lights, heaters, AC and etc.  You can also get upgrade these things like Over Head Grow lights or Large Heaters but they pretty much suck/useless.  You\\'d think you\\'d be able to put overhead lights, well, overhead your plants.  You can\\'t.  You figure that putting a Large Heater, right in front of your product would be sufficient enough.  Wrong.  You put it at a specific angle that doesn\\'t make any sense.  \\n\\nEmployees at your restaurants are constantly dropping things.  I\\'ve seen 3 year olds with iron like grips compared to these but wholes. I\\'ve once watched an employee pick up and drop the same burger 4 times in a row, leave it, then eventually come back before dropping it 2 more times. The worst part is, when they drop the food it becomes contaminated and will make customers sick who will eventually die (luckily there is no penalty for this...yet).  There is no way to get rid of the contaminated food.  You can\\'t even put a garbage can in the kitchen for these but wholes to just throw it away.  \\n\\nEmployees also seem to have a mind of their own and will outright refuse to do tasks that YOU have told them to do.  For some reason, my employees really hate making glazed donuts, even though they are tasked to do it, and the glazed donuts have their very own station and dedicated fryer and they refuse to make it.  You can fire employees but  I really hope they eventually add in the ability to just kill off these useless employees.\\n\\nWho also thought it was a great idea to make the burger fryer a special but-whole unit that must have a heater next to it or else it will explode?  If you do not maintain this thing with a heater (awkwardly placed, taking up valuable space) and maintenance man, it will explode and set your whole kitchen on fire.  \\n\\nGame crashes at the weirdest times too.  \"Oh, whats that?  You wanted to check on your employee\\'s condition?\" Crash. \"Oh, you like saving because I\\'m in EA?\" Crash. \"Oh, that youtube video you were watching went into a commercial break?\" Crash! (This literally happened last night to me).\\n\\nThis is really tough for me.  I really do see the potential of this game and it\\'s going to be fun, when it\\'s fixed up, but it\\'s current state is making me start to hate it.  I\\'m still sticking with my original review that this game is a big NO.  I\\'ll keep testing this product, for you and the devs, and will update when its working.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game has some work needed, but overall I think it\\'s pretty good.  \\n\\nFor the devs: the biggest problem I have with it at this point is that it needs a better system for distributing your wares.  The mopeds and cars are a great idea, but the problem is that it\\'s pretty tedious and difficult to see at a glance what is happening logistically.  \\n\\nAs an example, you get calls in the neighborhood requesting your goods.  You have to assign vehicles you own to take the goods to the location.  This is fine at first, but it quickly becomes obvious that there will be a lot of these requests and you\\'ll have to be going into the dispatch screen to just tell your cars to go to a bunch of places.  I think this detracts from the game a good bit.\\n\\nAlso, there\\'s not really a good way to distribute goods efficiently to the other businesses you own.  Cars get sent to locations regardless of how full the local storage is, meaning they could just be sitting overnight (since inventory is static at night) and only keep doing the rounds late in the morning.  Distribution could be automatic--stores request goods they want--or you could make a new job \"the dispatcher\" to handle those logistics.  Either way, the logistics are not great.\\n\\nI think the limit on factory workers based on plots owned doesn\\'t make a lot of sense and it\\'s a little unbalanced.  At the current setting, I don\\'t see a way to defend my factory and still produce.  Maybe this was intentional since attacks don\\'t yet seem to be a thing.\\n\\nStill some buggy things but overall, very nice little game.',\n",

So if you are on the fence let me say two things. \\n1) The game is missing a ton of content and nothing like the videos they post to sell this game. The videos also show items that are not in the EA which is deceptive to those buying.\\n2) The game will randomly die and crash at any moment. People complain about crashing. This has never happened to me. But the AI will bug out randomly. \\n\\nPROs\\n-------- \\n-- The Idea is great if done correct\\n-- I like the look of the game\\n-- Alot of potential\\n\\nCONS\\n--------\\n-- Tons of problems. Cleaners get stuck alot. The AI has so many issues that its hard to believe the game was released. The people playing this EA failed the programmers badly.\\n-- Only thing you can make is 3 Pots and cloudy Meth. Everything else is missing.\\n-- Only stores you can make is Laundry mat and doughnut store. Not sure if Chicken Shop is possible. Doughnut store is extremely buggy.\\n-- After 30 hours you seem to make more money making 3star cheap pot. Not much depth.\\n--- Way too many CONS to post.\\n\\nOne game I got attacked by the Mayor. Next game I created 4 guards and no attacks after 10 hours of play.\\nOVERALL - Tons of problems and tons of missing content. But maybe worth the wait. So far I find myself playing a ton just to see how fast I can make cash. For some reason this has gotten entertaining and addictive. \\n\\nADDED: Since Tom Merge responded and will hopefully read this. You should be embarrassed at the buggy mess the game was released in.

It has almost everything you would expect in a game of the genre. \\n\\n With that being said there is definitely room for improvement, first and foremost the tutorial pretty much taught me nothing about the game. A better tutorial would help out a lot. There are also quite a few bugs (to be expected) that you have to work around with the current state of the game. The point system to unlock new stuff doesn't seem to work entirely and makes progressing through the game harder and frustrating. The Devs have created a great building block with the early access release and I hope to see them build on that. This price should be a little lower on the game at the moment in my opinion, but if you can get it on sale it is for sure worth it.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you\\'re watching this tape, I\\'m probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn\\'t want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn\\'t know where to turn.\\nEventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I\\'m a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can\\'t take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is\\n\\nJokes aside, Really good game, I\\'m really excited for future Updates!',\n",

       "  'review': \"I think this could easily be another triple A game but the Mechanics need work.\\n-It's extremely slow. Seems like it takes real time 30 minutes to make a delivery. Not sure if that's true or not but it doesn't matter either way.\\n-The delivery system aside, the speed up button is extremely slow. 3x speed makes the game run slow and thats max speed. The minimum speed needs to be 6x what it is with a 1000% increase per speed up.\\n-this isn't a good project time game. Don't plan on spending a weekend playing, you will be watching TV and playing on your phone so much you will forget it's in the back ground.\\n-the vehicles suck. making basic deliveries to a persons house takes 4 mopeds minimum and later 2 cars. It's complete crap, I can't imagine rolling up to a standard house with 2 cars full of dope or 8 mopeds. 1 car, 1 house, 1 moped, 1 house, it should only require more if you are delivering on an industrial level in which case you should be making 20-30 thousand per delivery. 8 mopeds and 2 cars worth of dope to make 1.000 is ridiculous and not worth the time of playing.\\n-There's no explanation how to make the drugs grow. only the Dev can play this game.\\n          I can easily see this being a really good game with sandbox options or mods. Alternatively if the complains are ignored it will flop being an idle game at best.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[b] Target Audience: [/b]  Very Patient Players......Very Patient. [I] [/i]\\n\\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \\n\\nI admit, this one drove me up the wall. Look, I get that games may be a little rough in early access, and I try to keep an open mind when it comes to the gameplay to give updates. I know that a simulation genre is also one that it's a little bit tricky to do in early access: with multiple mechanics to refine and to mess with. But the first impression that Definitely Not Fried Chicken made with me was bad: and seem to frustrate me at every turn. Whether it being missing elements to snap back to our main area, confusing icons, or just not giving enough of a tutorial on certain things, all I could think was about other games like it that wouldn't be frustrating me as much as this one was.\\n\\nI mean look, if your employees literally are at 0 food or hygiene, and you can't specifically tell them to do that task, I expect the AI to be like “oh, I'm going to die. I probably should deal with this.” Instead, they went and watched TV. Like that's the kind of things that frustrated me through the game, whether it be apparently being able to build over my area with a road that I definitely didn't want, or having items take up way too much space on the playable area (why do I need two spaces for a wall dryer?!?). Frustrating controls aside: you don't even really get into the front part of the game until a bit later, and a rea at that point, you're just wanting to stab yourself to remove yourself from the experience.\\n\\nLike, maybe it'll build into a game worth something down the road. But right now, I have no confidence in the base product because there's so many problems left and right. \\n\\n\\n[b]Stream Footage:    [/b]  https://youtu.be/aIaRlLtjpgY\\n\\n\\n[u] Lists: [/u]\\n[b]Positives:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] A bit of mechanics. \\n[*] Some ok visuals. \\n [/list]\\n\\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] The pace of the mechanics is so fast and so many, that you can't keep track of everything when the game lets go and you get confused.\\n[*] The game's tutorial teaches you some mechanics....but not others. And then sorta makes you try to figure out things on the way.\\n[*] UI at times is frustrating to get through and keybinds for things you'd figure that you'd want (go to the base of your operation for example) aren't here.\\n[*] The game feels overly complex in certain areas (the schedule for example) that maybe should have waited to be introduced down the road.\\n[*] The worker AI will literally let itself be killed even if you literally try to tell it “hey, take the time you need, get yourself well.” It will ignore things like a shower and will watch TV instead if that one is semi-low, oh by the way YOU DIED DURING THAT TIME.\\n[*] Glitches like values staying on your mouse or people going through walls are common. \\n[*] The game takes a LONG time to load the first time around....on a machine that can games with 25x complexity in an instant. \\n[*] Just frustrating.\\n [/list]\\n\\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

They game-play mechanics are solid, but there are a lot of bugs like product being dropped and never picked up, AoE adjusters freezing, and no longer being adjustable until I reload the game.\\n\\nAlso things like heaters seem to be broken/bugged, because as far as I can tell there is zero difference between a small and large heater (or any other AoE item for that matter). and THEY COST WAY TOO FREAKING MUCH TO OPERATE! Like seriously I can't figure out a way to get a return on your investment with those things.\\n\\nTLDR This game really has the potential to be a fantastic tycoon style game, and probably will be someday.

       "  'review': \"READ WHOLE THING PLEASE\\n\\nOkay so yes I'm giving it a thumbs up. But the game isn't perfect and it's definitely got problems. I'm only giving it a thumbs up because there's no middle ground neutral button and I don't think it deserves a thumbs down.\\n\\nTechnically the game does what it sets out to do. It's a simulator game about drug peddling. The management is decent, the gameplay is sufficient and the loop is kinda fun and addictive. So because it does those fairly well it gets a thumbs up.\\n\\nHOWEVER\\n\\nThe game is broken to the point it almost crashed my PC half a dozen times. No i'm not exaggerating. During it's loading screen it freezes at minimal twice per loading screen and almost crashes every time.\\n\\nThen you've got certain functions simply not working. Game asked me to place a break room. I tried but nothing happened but the game still thought that it was built so it wanted me to continue doing the tutorial, only I couldn't. \\n\\nSo the game is still very unstable and honestly every time I try to open up the game I get nervous that it's going to destroy my PC.\\n\\nPlus the game is very unfinished, missing a lot of content which I suppose makes sense because it's early access but still I thought I should say so.\\n\\nAnd then you've got some functions of the gameplay that are downright poorly designed and need to be adjusted. Like the delivering of your goods to yoru customers. They take one box at a time, it's super slow and half the time you'll find yourself just staring at your screen for 5-10 minutes just waiting for orders to be completed while you're depleting money the whole time. The delivery needs to be sped up somehow or something I don't know but it needs to be more engaging then that.\\n\\nAlso I don't think that the pricetag is appropriate for this kind of game. Pixelated graphics. No voice acting. Generic sound effects. Repetetive gameplay loop.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a bad game, but I still think that the price tag is a bit too much for an investment. They are making us pay them to playtest their game and I think it's too much.\\n\\nIf you'd like a more in depth look at the game with more information then please check out the video I posted on my YouTube Channel. (Link Below).\\n\\nOtherwise thanks a bunch for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9A12vZnwhI\",\n",

Despite a few minor bugs I've come across, I am really excited that this game is now on early access. It is way too much fun managing your drug manufacturing on top of managing your day-to-day store fronts to push your product. As long as the developers keep up with what they have been doing during development, I think this game can be huge. I spent $20 on the pre-EA build and don't know how much it's selling for on early access, but the $20 I spent feels completely worth it in my opinion. This isn't the most in depth review ever, but I just wanted to give my love for this game and it's devs and also congrats to the developers for reaching early access!\",\n",

It is a musou game, but there is enough variety in the attacks and strategy available to you to allow for really interesting combos and the like. On highest difficulty you'll need to at least try to understand your combo charts, buffs, and act around the actions of your servant. \\n\\nTechnically there are very few issues, only three visual issues I've noticed\\n-Sometimes shadows dont draw correctly immediately, especially from afar\\n-for whatever reason when you walk or have Iori doing a pretty small or slow animation, there is a slight amount of jittering, most noticeable if you walk through town \\n-Link attack popup animations are very low res and gross to look at at 1440p at least\\n\\nAside from those small things though the game looks, controls, and sounds fantastic. Sure you're beating up the same people over and over again, but there is enough to interrupt the mindless slashing with quick thinking and strategy at least on highest difficulty. Boss fights actually have mechanics and some thought that goes into them, although there are some prevailing strats. Leyline battles are simple but fun enough time trial attacks where you get rewarded based on the speed of your clear. That really all I can say. Game is fun :)\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Very surprising game, there's a lot of systems to keep the combat interesting with a bunch of different servants to use. The story so far has been pretty great so far with the exception of there being too many instances of people just escaping from you. The textures of the world aren't the best but overall id say the game looks pretty good. Music is a bop with a ton of different tracks. Overall I definitely recommend this if you are a Fate fan, lots of little nods to FGO fans aswell. Its probably the best actual Fate game released so far.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Writing this review right after completing the game and stepping into NG+, so don\\'t give me that shit about \"damn didn\\'t clear the game and already hating on it\".\\n\\nI didn\\'t even know they could make musou game that would genuinely be bad, as the genre itself is not really know for being complex when it comes to mechanics, but holy shit, this game is BAD. \\nHow could they fuck up such a premise when there are two EXTELLA games that exist? All you had to do is to give us a musou game with servants. In the meantime you see comments like \"MOMMY MUSASHI\" and \"JALTER MY BELOVED\", but you are playing Musashi for a total of 15 minutes, and then JAlter you play for like 15 seconds, only for A SINGLE SECTION they let you control Jeanne. This is fucked up. Actually, no, this is beyond fucked up. I don\\'t even care if that spoils the game to someone because I bought this game for the premise of playing as JAlter because I thought they\\'ll give you like a Free Mode type thing where you can replay encounters with anyone you want, BUT NO, THERE IS NO SUCH THING. Don\\'t be lured in by all the positive feedback. Maybe they\\'ll give you more servant gameplay through season pass, but have you seen the price for that shit?! Doubt it\\'ll be worth it. And if that means that you\\'re playing more Iori, then double no from me. Game does look amazing, and I love the artstyle of it, but goddamn am I just empty after clearing it.\\nAlso, three billion tutorials.\\n\\nYour main gameplay loop is playing the weakest musou character they could come up with, Iori. Why is he the weakest? Well cause everyone gets hyper armor whenever you are fighting as him. The only way to actually deal damage to anyone larger than you is to break their armor by countering or just waiting till their move is done and then time your strikes while their defence is \"lowered\". You wanna have fun and play a cool character, which is basically like any servant in the game? We got you. Here\\'s a bar that lasts ~20 seconds that you have to grind for 30 years as Iori, and then maybe by divine intervention you can play a servant until you\\'ve just barely familiarized yourself with their movesets. People who played through the game will tell me \"BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU PLAY SERVANTS ONLY\" and yeah, sure, that would be an argument if you could play them for more than 15 minutes of in-game time. But alas, this is not what Fate game is about I guess. Totally not. Don\\'t be fooled, you\\'re not playing servants in this game for the most part. Even NG+ is just that, it\\'s same game but with your progress already being there. I\\'m disappointed beyond belief. I pre-ordered it because I dreamed of a musou game with servants, given Extella was the only thing closest to that, so I had hopes when I saw Koei making a Fate game. Beaten it because that\\'s the only way I can justify spending money on this piece of shit. And even then it just left me with a bigger feeling of disappointment. Cause the whole time I played, I was hoping that the game will allow me to just pick servants I wanna play as and ditch the stupid and weak Iori. I just wanted a musou game with servants that\\'s not riddled with stupid tile-conquering gameplay shtick and I couldn\\'t even get that, unbelievable. \\nDo not buy this. Just don\\'t. Maybe on sale 10 years later along with whatever content comes out for it later, but not full price. This is a huge flop and I hope that whoever is writing those positive reviews will wake up and see the game for what it is.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Pros:\\n- This game takes Fate back to its roots. You have a roster of very cool and mysterious servants who all of their true names hidden. The masters are interesting and the dynamic between master-servant pairs is actually relevant again.\\n- Character designs have returned to that grounded Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero style. This game is a breath of fresh air from the overly \"Tropey and Anime\" designs that FGO and Fate/Apocrypha started to introduce.\\n- The cutscenes are fantastic. I feel like I\\'m watching Unlimited Blade Works again for the first time when a fight scene is being shown.\\n- Character progression is easy to understand and meaningful. The moves you learn are flashy and fun to use. Changing stances actually changes the way you play\\n- Enemy designs are either completely new or taken from FGO and given a nice makeover. If you remember the little Onis from Shimousa or the Kintoki rider event, those make an appearance and they actually look creepy.\\n- There\\'s a saint quartz joke.\\n- Grail Front inspired combat makes it in the game with a fresh coat of paint and is very fun.\\n- You get paid to pet dogs and cats.\\n- Noble Phantasms look pretty badass.\\n- Voice acting is pretty great.\\n    - Gilgamesh\\n\\nCons:\\n- This style of JRPG isn\\'t for everyone. It plays similar to Extella or Hyrule Heroes in the sense that its designed kind of like a hoard hack and slash. It\\'s redeemed by the fact that major targets/bosses have cool moves and are fun to fight against. I was hesitant my money was well spent at first but the gameplay improved.\\n- Your servant is another saberface, which is a minor critique at best. Her character design is changed enough that she definitely looks unique.\\n- If you aren\\'t on controller you\\'re gonna need to do some serious work on key-bind remapping to make the game feel good. Once you find your sweet spot though it plays pretty good.\\n- That\\'s it. Those are all my problems with the game.',\n",

Before going into this game understand YOU PLAY THIS GAME AS A SINGLE DUDE AND THE SERVANT SECTION IS A POWER UP MID FIGHT.\\n\\nI've seen lot's of upset people you can't swap between numerous servants on the fly for this game's combat and I don't want to mislead people. You play as a single voiced protagonist with a single servant, and later on I imagine you unlock the ability to fight with other servants. Mid fight after raising a special gauge you switch to controlling your servant for a time before swapping back. This is pretty much Fate Warriors but with a lot more stuff to do outside of beating people up. If you like warriors, yay. If you don't like warriors... well you may hate this game or be meh about it.\\n\\nStory I'm barely into it so far but if you've watched one Fate property, you've seen them all. This series quite literally has one plot it constantly reuses but with new masters and servants, and this game is no different. Don't go in expecting an amazingly unique experience unless you have never seen Fate in your life, in which case you can go into this game perfectly fine and will probably find it interesting.\\n\\nAs of how far I am in the game, this is like a 7/10 as someone who likes Fate, and as someone who is FINE with warriors gameplay.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It's just like something out of one of my Japanese animes!\\n\\nThis is the closest they've come to making a playable version of the original Fate/Stay Night VN in spirit. It only took 20 years. Accessible entry point for newcomers that want to see what the franchise is about.\\n\\nThe main warning I'd give is that, like the VN, there is a *lot* of reading. The game really revels in creating a distinct sense of place, and it benefits greatly from this. In much the same way you come to learn the streets of kamurocho in Yakuza, you get similar vibes here, plus the historical aspect which is omnipresent.\\n\\nCombat is solid, and good enough for the fraction of the game it takes up. Would have preferred a full character action style  but the game layers a lot of additional systems on top of the basic musou light and heavy system. Boss fights are genuinely really quite good, and the hard difficulty is punishing, but not crazy hard or anything.\\n\\nGraphics are pleasant enough but not cutting edge by any means. Could probably have been a PS3 game, albeit not with this resolution and framerate. High budget cutscenes are all stellar, and feel like you're watching one of the ufotable shows.\\n\\nInterested to see what they do with DLC, hope they add more content for the other servants as that seems to be one of the larger complaints at present.\\n\\nOh and this game's Saber is also fantastic. Great facial expressions.\",\n",

What if we did that again with surface level changes?\"\\n- The game looks amazing visually\\n\\nThe bad\\n- World feels rather empty.

       "  'review': 'Game in itself is great, BUT.....\\n\\nBeware M+K Players. \\n\\nReasons:\\n\\n- UI/Menuing is horrible with M+K, no mouse functionality here. You can not use Clicks for neither \"Confirm\" nor \"Cancel\"\\n\\n- That in itself is arguably bearable, if not for the fact that the \"Confirm\" and \"Cancel\" functions are unchangeable set at \"Enter\" and \"Backspace\",... smart control scheme if you intent to play with a Mouse.\\n\\n- Receiving an Item can not be confirmed by a simple click, you are forced to use \"Enter\", because the function can not be set to another key...\\n\\n- \"Lock on\", disables free camera movement, classic Gamepad Control scheme without consideration for M+K players\\n\\n- The game does not recognize additional Mouse Buttons, meaning only left/right Click and the middle button are usable.\\n\\n[b]UPDATE:[/b] Selecting Skills is also very rough. You are supposed to hold LCTRL or F then press V/B/N or Space during Combat with WASD movement. \\nNot to mention V/B/N or Space can not be reassigned to another key for this function. \\n\\n[b] So if you are not ready to swap to a Gamepad, be ready for a rough M+K experience.[/b]\\n\\nThe combat in itself, apart from \"Lock on\" feels okay with M+K, though.\\n\\nDespite liking the game, i will use this negative review to warn interested players about the rough M+K support.\\n\\nI shall change this review , if the game receives a Patch solving these issues. With a 70$ price tag a consumer is allowed to expect better M+K support in the year 2023...\\n\\nDevs could you please fix this for all the players, who prefer to play with M+K ? ',\n",

       "  'review': 'The story takes place in 17th-century Japan during the Keian Uprising. You take the role of of Iori Miyamoto, disciple of the legendary Miyamoto Musashi. Iori earns his living by doing odd jobs, following his code of honour to keep the peace. After a strange mark appears on the back of one of his hands, the young man finds himself unwillingly drawn into the Waxing Moon Ritual. In a desperate situation, Iori manages to summon a Servant and confirm his participation in the Ritual as Master. Saber is summoned...\\n\\nFor a newcomer to the Fate franchise, the beginning is usually difficult. Even though Fate has anime adaptations and one of the longest-running mobile games, it\\'s still difficult to introduce a newcomer to the Fate Series without giving them a link to a 5k page wiki... Nevertheless, it was difficult before Fate/Samurai Remnant. The game gently introduces you to the Fate universe, explaining absolutely everything you need to know to fight effectively in a Holy Grail War. I was surprised at how simply and effectively the game explained what are relatively difficult concepts!\\n\\nAlthough Fate/Samurai Remnant is essentially an action-RPG, it offers a long, detailed and complete story, a quality that lives up to the standards of the Fate franchise. Veteran fans of the franchise will find all the ingredients of a good Type-Moon title here. The story explains every element and rule of a Holy Grail War in detail, ensuring that those unfamiliar with the franchise will be able to follow the story smoothly and easily. Once you\\'ve completed the game, you can start a new game to access an extended storyline, a modified ending and brand new scenes that give you even more information about the lore. A classic Type-Moon.\\n\\nOf course, I can\\'t talk about Fate/Samurai Remnant without mentioning Saber. Ah, Saber... I\\'ve lost count of the number of times my quest told me to go right when Saber was on my left, gazing at a food stall... Probably one of the most endearing characters in the entire Fate series! The bond that develops between Iori and Saber is one of the highlights of the game. Little by little, Iori gets to know and understand Saber. In exchange, Saber will get used to Iori\\'s calm and peaceful character, while trying to understand how Miyamoto Musashi\\'s student sees the world... The other characters won\\'t leave you unmoved either. You\\'ll quickly feel a sense of friendship for the Rogue Servants, while surprising yourself with compassion for the other Master-Servant duo, who all have their own stories to tell. You\\'ll also be given a few lessons in history and mythology to help you understand the \"power\" of the True Names of the Servants!\\n\\nIn terms of Gameplay, it would be a bit reductive to say that this is a simple Musou. While Saber can wipe out weak enemies with a single blow, the bosses are... Much more difficult. If you want to understand why I thought first of a \"inspired\" Souls-like game, just play Iori and turn the difficulty up to the max... The boss stages will be a real challenge! The different styles of Iori\\'s swords prevent repetition in battle and force you to rethink your strategy, as Iori adapts his style to his opponents in order to win. I particularly liked the stark difference in power between Iori and Saber. You feel all the weakness of a simple, brave human and the monstrous power of a true Heroic Spirit! This difference is also felt when Iori confronts a Servant. Without Saber\\'s help, it\\'s hard to imagine Musashi\\'s adopted son winning... Each Servant has their own unique fighting style, so you\\'ll enjoy trying them all!\\n\\nIn conclusion, Fate/Samurai Remnant is an excellent introduction to the Fate Series. Beginners will discover all the basics of the universe while enjoying a story full of twists and turns and terribly engaging characters. As for confirmed fans, I\\'m not taking the slightest risk in saying that you\\'ll find what you\\'re looking for as a Fate series fan in this title! This new Type-Moon x Koei Tecmo game is an unforgettable Fate experience!',\n",

       "  'review': \"FOR ANY NON-FATE FANS WONDERING IF YOU NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FATE TO PLAY THIS:\\nYou don't have to know a single thing about the Fate series to play this game. \\nNot only do they teach you how the war and history of the grail wars go, this is also a new installment in the Fate franchise. Completely tied to nothing else in any way\\n\\nNow for my 7.5hr review:\\nThe beginning of the story is about how any other Fate story would go, but now set in the Edo period of Japan.\\nThe Masters are all very unique. So are the Master's Servants and Rogue Servants\\nThe gameplay has a lot going for it. From little mini-games like honing your blade and woodcarving to core gameplay mechanics having tag team systems and link attacks.\\n\\nMY MAIN DRAWBACK FROM THE GAME:\\nLike the Fate/Extella games, the controls on mouse and keyboard are atrocious. You HAVE to play on controller to have a good experience. I hope one day this is something they actually try to care about rather than it feeling like an afterthought.\\n\\nAs fan of Fate for over a decade i can say this is probably their most dense game yet. Even after 7+ hours im only in the beginning stage of Ch.2 (Still waiting on Fate/Extra Record!!)\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I am a huge Fate/ franchise fan. I was probably going to like this game regardless, so feel free to let that color everything else I have to say.\\n\\nI was immediately apprehensive when it was announced and in the trailer there was the Omega Force logo. Omega Force are excellent developers, but they live in their niche and thrive there. As great as Omega Force are at diversifying the gameplay in their licensed Warriors titles, it\\'s already been done in the franchise with both Extella and Extella Link being musou games. \\n\\nThankfully, they managed to find an excellent balance with what they know and new mechanics. Combos initially flow like those in a musou game, linear chains of light attacks followed with a heavy, but they inject a need to react and play off the opponents that is so often missing from their more typical fare.\\n\\nThey also manage to make the player character feel strong and useful, while demonstrating the huge gulf that exists between Masters and Servants as far as their strength. You don\\'t feel underpowered or useless, but you absolutely do need your Servant to survive. Enemies aren\\'t like those in other Omega Force titles, they can take a beating and if you fail to stay on your toes, they will punish you and easily deplete your HP bar.\\n\\nStrictly viewing this as a Fate/ game, this is the best adaptation of a Holy Grail War in any non-Visual Novel game so far. It perfectly captures the delicate act of having to balance the facade of daily life while also uncovering the other Masters, preparing for nightfall when the veil of secrecy is easier to maintain and all out Servant vs Servant combat can really take place. \\n\\nAs far as the story they do retread some well-worn story beats, borrowing from tropes established in more than a few Fate/ stories. It does make for an excellent introduction to the franchise for first timers though, and a entrenched fan will probably find it nostalgic. [spoiler] I will buy it a second copy on console if any of these idiots say, \"People die when they are killed\". You have my word. [/spoiler]\\n\\nOmega Force and Koei Tecmo as a whole have really out done themselves with this release',\n",

       "  'review': \"This game takes zero risks. The gameplay is yet another Musou game with a band-aid on it in a terrible attempt to pretend it is an action RPG in the Musou engine that has made copy/paste trash but with whatever IP logo on the same game since the early 2000s. Rather than make a real game or take any risks, all these companies pay this company to shit out another turd with a new name and the same copy paste animations and attacks and same terrible AI enemies with rocks for brains that have been there from the first game. The story hits all the same copy/paste of every other Fate series game, insert Saber, can't tell you her name, cute and charming so you like her, protagonist is boring self insert unlikable trash.\\n\\nI will be so happy when the Fate series finally drops the horrible shitty Musou developers and their horrible trash tier combat systems and PS2 style graphics. Get it on sale for $20-30 at most. It's just another trash Musou game with BARELY more mechanics, but a polished turd is still a turd. Musou games are bottom tier effort cheap trash that even mobile phone games out class these days in Gameplay. Save your money and don't encourage them to keep going for cheap cash grabs like this. The day they drop the Musou developers, is the day I start buying every Fate game to release as I'm a huge Fate fan and I want a decent game to buy and play, but they just won't give me one.\\n\\nThis game serves as an excellent litmus test for which review companies or channels are lying to you. If anyone dares give this higher than a 7.0/10 then you know they are the most die hard Fate fan to the point they are hallucinating a good game or they literally never touched a good game before in their life and are only comparing it to the cheapest worst anime knockoff games made. If you want a solid Fate title, sadly, Melty Blood is still the only thing you have. Melty Blood is worth more than the 18th Musou game with the Fate logo slapped on it and the recreation of the same story but with minor tweaks.\\n\\nI want a good Fate game as much as I want a Saber arc anime from Ufotable. Fate is my favorite series and that is all the more why it is so infuriating to see cheap anime fan cash grabs rather than a game that does the series justice. If you are ok buying the 13th Musou game that is absolutely no different from the last 23 they made, by all means, enjoy. But those with half decent taste in games will stay away. Refunded, not worth even half what I paid for it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"tl;dr Worth the wait if you're a musou fan and you don't hate TYPE MOON or a TYPE MOON fan and you don't hate musou games.\\n\\n---------------\\n\\nBased on my initial impressions of the game, I'd say it's more or less following a more open version of the Persona 5 Strikers formula. It's really technically smooth too for me; haven't run into any crashes or anything like that. Some occasional stutter while loading shaders but that goes away the more you play. I have heard about the cutscene skipping bug some people are experiencing; I really hope that Omega Force fixes it, since this game is pretty darn good at first shot.\\n\\nYou got an open world with different zones to walk around and do missions in, you got some navigation that can be done with the help of your servant, dual techs, follow-up strikes, you can temporarily swap to your servant and fight as them for a while, you equip gear, learn spells that use consumables... it's pretty expansive, and has a lot of strong RPG elements that give each character a strong progression curve. The musou combat is on point, though I wish the battles were larger. I hope they get larger later in the game.\\n\\nI've seen some people liken the game to the RGG Studios games as well; walking around town, doing small missions and favors and errands for people, and yeah I would say that's present but not really that oppressive. The point of the game is to ease you into the battles and get you used to these micro-encounters with 25-50 enemies at once, much like Persona 5 Strikers did.\\n\\nI think the main problem with this game though, for most people, is probably going to be that it's pretty niche for what it is; you have to really be a neutral-to-positive fan of both musou games and TYPE MOON, particularly Fate, to really like this. If you are, then this will probably be one of your favorite games to come out this year; and you also probably don't need to be convinced by me to buy it.\\n\\nBut, for the rest of the internet, I think it's probably worth waiting for a sale. This definitely isn't a game that you can use to get into Fate; the story is a mimicry of the core beats of the original Fate/stay Night story, but it won't tell you about anything you'll see in the other big name Fate franchises, instead being more of an isolated story that uses similar themes and ideas. It might be a game you can use to get into the musou genre, but because of its open world and RPG elements, it's very different from the more mission and campaign-based structure of the mainline Dynasty Warriors games, or even the earlier spinoff licensed titles like One Piece: Pirate Warriors, Berserk & The Band Of The Hawk or Hyrule Warriors.\\n\\nThe bottom line is, for fans this is exactly what they want, but for anyone who isn't already in on this type of game or franchise, there's nothing here that will blow your mind or turn you into a fan of either that couldn't be found in one of the games I mentioned earlier in this review. Because of that, while I can easily recommend this to a certain type of person, if you're not really familiar with TYPE MOON or with the musou genre, I would wait for this one to go on sale before you experiment with it.\\n\\nFor the rest of you, you've probably already made up your mind about this game; go download it and play it! It's great.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[quote][h1]Video review: https://youtu.be/iqwEVZNC0w4\\nWritten review below![/h1][/quote]\\n\\nI may like this series and there are some good elements, but honestly, my experience with Fate/Samurai Remnant was just painful.\\n\\n[b]Note: Trimmed to fit Steam, check video for full version![/b]\\n\\n[h2]Combat[/h2]\\nI will start with the good. For one, the core combat mechanics are actually pretty good, great even. You get a handful of stances to swap between and are actually encouraged to do so depending on your HP level, how many enemies you are fighting, and what stats you want to prioritize. It adds a good bit of depth to the otherwise mashfest that is Musou-style gameplay. There is still a bit of mashing, but I liked the extra layers added here.\\n\\n[h2]Gameplay Loop & Difficulty[/h2]\\nIt is just unfortunate that this combat is stuck with some incredibly repetitive and tedious mission design. The game literally opens with you helping a guy collect debts from random people around town. That’s how bad it is.\\n\\nWhen you are not running random errands as main story quests, you are dealing with this absolutely tedious turn-based board game style travel system. You have to travel between nodes to get to your destination and if you run into an enemy along the way, jump into a copy-paste arena to fight them in.\\n\\nAnd the enemies are copy-paste too. You will be fighting the same type of samurai and a handful of monsters the entire game. You occasionally get some new, interesting ones, but it just becomes tiring spamming buttons against the same enemies battle after battle. Especially so given how this game manages its difficulty level: by simply raising enemy HP. Bosses especially, since they get an extra armor meter that just takes forever to break before you actually do damage. It’s not like the bosses are even hard, just boring and time-consuming.\\n\\n[h2]Story[/h2]\\nThe gameplay is only about half of the experience, maybe just 30-40% of it. The rest is visual novel style storytelling, which I honestly don’t mind as a VN fan, but not so when it is as wordy and full of fluff like it is here. For every actual cutscene, you get a full 30 minute dinner dialogue scene. One cool character reveal, and then an info dump where a character explains a simple concept to death as if I was five years old.\\n\\nIt’s just frustrating. Boring and frustrating. I know the Fate franchise is full of lengthy stories, but I don’t recall ever being as bored with them as I was here. The pacing is just far too slow.\\n\\n[h2]Performance / PC Port[/h2]\\nI had no issues playing at 4k 120fps, although it was a bit weird that the game is divided into performance and quality modes on PC, the latter of which listed a 60fps limit. The game still looked fine in performance mode - at least, for this developer’s standard - so I can’t say I minded all that much. There are a bunch of video settings to change too, so props to the devs for that instead of just leaving it as one slider as they have definitely done in the past.\\n\\n[h2]Overall[/h2]\\nI cannot recommend Fate/Samurai Remnant. There are obviously some good ideas here, especially with the combat mechanics, but the gameplay loop, the mission design, and the story full of filler really sour the experience. The Fate/Extella games may have their issues, but they are at least better than this.\\n\\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews + videos!',\n",

       "  'review': \"MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE is a free to play fightering battle royale based on the anime My Hero Academia. The game is okay, it's fun enough. 8 teams of 3 people match, which of course you don't need to stick together. The gameplay is okay and kind of confusing. There's too many buttons to keep track of, you have 6 abilities + items. And when multi  The huge glaring problem I have with the game is the micro-transactions and the multi of in-game currency. Unlocking characters are through a slow level-up or a gacha loot box. I found 2 characters I liked playing, but they are days/weeks of non-stop griding games and I'm losing the will to play anymore playing characters I'm not having fun with anymore. At the end of the day, it's a free to play game, you literally don't lose anything to download and play it. It's fine.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h2] TL;DR It has promise, but in its current state I wouldn\\'t recommend playing this for more than a few hours. [/h2]\\n\\nThe assets [u]heavily[/u] borrow from the My Hero Fighting Game, which are vibrant and fun (especially if you\\'re a fan of the anime) meaning you can pick up one of the hero\\'s / villains you love most in the show and use their iconic abilities. The skeleton/ framework of the game feels to me like a near copy of the Naruto: Shinobi Striker game. So this is a mashup of those two [b] with all of the pro\\'s and con\\'s of both [/b].\\n\\nThe abilities look and feel powerful for most characters, meaning you can hop back and forth between different characters and mess around with play styles. I\\'ve enjoyed the speed based characters the most (Ochaco, Froppy and Ida) as they feel the most unique in using terrain to their advantage. \\n\\nAlthough the abilities look wonderful in the cell shaded style they feel quite heavy and can take up a lot of the screen leading you to easily get yourself lost in a fight with another team. In addition. you\\'ll find that if you\\'ve had your shield broken by two abilities/ attacks that you\\'ll be getting knocked over constantly. The evade window works in a 1v1 setting, but, in this 3v3 game-mode dodging (using Ctrl as default) feels absolutely pointless. \\n\\nMenu-ing is atrocious, honestly some of the worst I\\'ve seen in a multiplayer game, it feels un-intuitive and screens are never as easy to access as you\\'d like. Why can\\'t you unlock characters in the shop, why do some menu icons feel like they need to be clicked twice to access and why is readying up in a small box to the left instead of underneath your character?\\n\\nMonetisation what you can expect from a standard free-to-play gacha game. I\\'ve counted 4 main currencies as well as 3 others that unlock items in the \"gallery\"? Horrible way to pad out timed challenges and battle passes. On top of this, [b] locking characters behind a paywall [/b] will inevitably lead to a toxic Pay2Win environment with some characters being stronger than others, regardless of skill. \\n\\nThe devs have counteracted this by giving new users access to one character ticket to unlock whoever you\\'d like which is a good start, but I doubt it\\'ll help the longevity of the game.  \\n\\n[h3] Here\\'s what I\\'d like to see improved [/h3]\\n- Abilities being on a decent cool down leading to fights needing to rely more on melee and the dodge mechanic\\n- Much simpler menu\\'s \\n- More Game mode\\'s (including solo and team based objectives)\\n- Revive\\'s easier to collect (one ticket rather than three) but are more visible and longer to cast.\\n- Plus Ultra having a kind of Ultimate/ Super attack as at the minute it feels lack luster\\n- Objectives other than box opening and rescuing \\n\\nA Solid 5/10, will keep my eye on it over the coming months.',\n",

       "  'review': 'If you are wondering whether or not this game is worthy of an install read this. The overall game play is very fluid. Your objective is clear and how to accomplish it even clearer. There is a lootbox system to get free cosmetics and if you roll duplicates you get rewarded with another currency to buy MORE cosmetics. The only down side to this game I would have to say is the way you unlock characters Such as Froppy, Bakugo, Todoroki, Mr. Compress and All Might. You have a separate leveling system aside from your account level and License Level(BP). And it takes a very long time just to scrape from Level 0 to 1. Then it becomes a little easier and XP feels as if its coming in larger quantities. But other than that the way the game works, the mechanics, the characters and the cosmetics are 10/10. I suggest installing it if you are a first-timer and try playing about 10 games of UNRANKED. Oh right! There is also a ranked mode for those competitive souls among us! You get to climb through the ranks of Beginner, Amateur, Pro, and Ace. But anyways. Install the game. Get your cosmetics and play about 10 games to really get a feel for it. I recommend it all the way. At the time of writing this I have about 30 hours in the game.',\n",
